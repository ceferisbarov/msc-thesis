"The Dentist" arrived late in the era of psycho-professionals. Dr. Feinstone, a perfect dentist, sees his life unravel due to an IRS agent, his unfaithful wife, and patient issues, leading him to madness and violent actions. Directed by Brian Yuzna, known for stylish horror movies like "Re-Animator," and produced by Pierre David, the film stars Corbin Bernsen, who impressively plays the disturbed dentist. Linda Hoffman is convincing as his naive wife, Michael Stadvec has a minor role, Ken Foree plays a cop, and Virginya Keehne is a potential victim. Warning: If you fear dentists, proceed with caution; expect dark humor and gruesome scenes.
This film is a dud with a fake soundstage feel and awful rear-screen projection. A good plot idea is buried in a poor script, making it hard to care about the characters. The directing is pedestrian and doesn't help the script. While Randolph Scott is his charming self and Ms. Wymore looks good yet delivers poor lines, Phil Carey annoys in his role. Comic attempts fall flat, though the Spanish songs are enjoyable. It's not unbearable but definitely mediocre.
"It's all about the family." That has to be the worst line in a "horror" movie, although this couldn't be horror even if it tried! Ugh! Owen Wilson is a better actor and should stop playing the token guy who always dies in action movies (Anaconda, Armageddon). He co-wrote "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore," so he has talent. Lily Taylor should stick to indie films; she doesn't belong here. Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star, as there's no place for her in legitimate acting. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
The only real highlight is the death of the sniveling guy and the other characters' reactions. Otherwise, it's a lame rip-off of Jaws, Lake Placid, and Alligator, with some Godzilla (1998). Standard for 1990s horror, two non-starring females undress, but the female lead doesn’t. The movie revolves around "blood surfing," an extreme sport with surfers cutting themselves in shark-infested waters. A giant salt-water crocodile appears, people get eaten, and the movie ends. It's a dull bad horror movie.
I remember being passionate about the show and determined not to miss any episodes. We had no VCR, so I haven't seen the series again, but I recall how thrilled I was watching it. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor then and remains so due to his role in the series. I would go to great lengths to see it again and revisit my childhood. Any ideas? Does anyone know a site devoted to the series or have episodes from their first airing?
"Hitler, the Rise of Evil" offers a clear look at the corrupt ways Hitler rose to power and ends there. The film effectively portrays this period with strong acting, especially Peter O'Toole as President von Hindenburg. It's set in an acceptable 1930s environment and makes for a good watch. My copy also includes a second DVD with documentaries on Hitler's personality and the 1983 Hitler-diaries forgery scandal, which tarnished several historians' and journalists' reputations.
Rachel York was fantastic as "Lucy." I've seen her in "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Victor/Victoria," and she always delivers diverse, real characters. It's surprising to see negative reviews about her performance, with critics focusing too much on her looks instead of her depth. Rachel didn't just impersonate Lucy; she revealed the real woman behind the clown, especially in rehearsal scenes for iconic skits like Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory, giving them a fresh twist. She nailed routines like the Professor and Grape Stomping, capturing Lucy's essence perfectly. Critics may have expected the "I Love Lucy" persona throughout the movie, but Rachel's portrayal showed a natural progression, planting the seeds of the comedian Lucy would become. She deftly captured the complexity of Lucille Ball with authenticity and freshness. Rachel's performance was a star turn, deserving more great roles and an Emmy.
As a former submariner, this was one of the worst submarine movies I have seen. A mutiny on a US Naval vessel, especially a Nuclear Powered Trident submarine, is unthinkable. These men are highly dedicated and responsible, from the Captain to the junior crew member. An Executive Officer behaving like Denzel Washington's character would be relieved, court-martialed, and expelled from the Navy. The Navy's lack of technical advice for this film is no surprise. Submariners are trained to be quiet to avoid detection, not making noise like in the movie. Loud music and noise would never be tolerated. This portrayal is over the top and ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
`Europa' (also known as `Zentropa') is one of the most visually stunning films I've seen, blending grayscale and color photography seamlessly. It was a contender for the 1991 Golden Palm in Cannes, which went to the stylistically similar Barton Fink by the Coen brothers. Rent both films and judge for yourself.
Not a very good movie but accurately depicts torture techniques. It effectively shows the brutality of the NK POW camps with surprising frankness for the time. Despite technical flaws, it reveals a forgotten corner of a forgotten war with some nasty stuff. It's interesting to compare this to later films like "Go Tell The Spartans."
Towards the end of this thriller, Ally Sheedy's gaunt appearance is hauntingly evil, suggesting she could excel in a nasty Bette Davis-type role. However, there are few other reasons to watch this. Sally Kirkland's sex-starved crazy woman is tiresome, and the tension sags during her scenes. Savage's drunken insurance agent is distasteful but thankfully a small role. Nicholas Walker's performance as Paul Keller is unsympathetic and wooden. Dara Tomanovich improves scenes with Sheedy a bit. Sheedy's meticulous, understated performance is admirable but out of context. The sets are drab, and the camera work is undistinguished.
It's a poorly done film with a lot of violence, following typical slasher tropes: isolated place, cocky campers, wilderness trip. There are intense scenes but it's dull with bad editing. Ghost children sound odd, rules unclear, includes a gross cannibalism scene. It's gratuitous, desensitizing violence with no cleverness. Lots of blood; little plot.
This is the worst movie Adam's done, but he was happy to have it. There are 3-4 laughs, but I used the fast forward button. Don't waste your time. I saw it to complete his filmography, but it sucked.
As a Film studies graduate, I have seen many films, but 'Summer Rain' is the worst. I hoped it would be a great British classic, but my flatmates and I ended up laughing and cringing at the terrible acting and cheesy script. The main characters, Michelle and Gary, were annoying from the start. Michelle has a face you'd never tire of slapping, and Gary was so emotional that I didn't care about either of them by the end. I paid £3 for this disaster and felt compelled to warn others to avoid it at all costs. Thanks for reading.
One of the most idiotic films ever made. Shecky (Sandler) is a cruise ship waiter wanting to be a comedian. Not one funny or clever line. Unfunny and pathetic. Surprisingly little crude or sexual humor, but plenty of f-words. Low budget ruins it, making the cruise ship seem like a small boat with only 10 extras, including Billy Bob Thornton. Cheap animated opening credits. I hate this movie, and others will too. 86 mins. Rated R for Language.
The fight scenes emulate slow-motion Jackie Chan but fall flat, and the attempts at wit are pathetic. Brandon Lee shows some charisma despite poor lines, while Dolph Lundgren lacks it entirely. The love scenes are awkward due to the reliance on a body double. (*1/2)
Do we need more narcissistic garbage on the Baby Boomer generation? Though technically a Boomer, I remember when the "idealistic youths" of the '60s engaged in destructive behavior. Most were just fools. This is another exercise in self-importance from those who never grew up.
Though dated, the movie's timeless and funny underdog tale lets audiences relate to hapless Buster fighting against odds in the Stone Age, Roman Age, and Modern Age. Buster's character adapts to different eras, highlighting comedic early "caveman" stereotypes and Roman gladiatorial twists. Its theme shows how we continue facing similar struggles to "win the girl" across time. Watching it now, over eighty years later, reveals how much has changed since its "modern times."
This movie sucks. The idea of a machine transforming matter into energy and reassembling it is interesting, but they ruin it by breaking the machine. The story misses potential explorations of responsibility and temptation. Instead, the doctor jerry-rigs the machine and fails, leading him to kill people, which could have been avoided if Lembach hadn't left. The addition of a dull British relationship doesn't help. The movie earns 2 stars for effort, but breaking the machine and causing all the chaos was a mistake. Damn you, Lembach!
Great times working with the Quiroz Brothers and the cast as the "Guy on the Bench." They perfectly captured the traits of a true "B" horror film. I hope to work with Pumpkin Patch Pictures again. After moving to Detroit, I've been recognized in public several times. Once, a girl in a video store nearly lost her mind and I signed her receipt. I asked a Blockbuster employee if the movie rented often, and she confirmed it was renting more than Ring2. The title captures urban market interest, and many customers haven't returned the movie, suggesting it's so good they don't want to give it back. Watch out for ZoMbIeS in the hood! Jaysun Barr (Guy on the Bench-2005)
A flying saucer with 20 male space explorers travels millions of light years to a colony founded 25 years ago on a 'forbidden planet.' They find an advanced robot, a socially inept young woman, and her hermit philologist father. The story is a pulp scifi mystery, loosely compared to Shakespeare's Tempest. It's a cautionary tale about progress and technology but retains hopefulness. The special effects and aesthetics make up for the uninspired directing and uneven acting. Despite its 1950s props, it seems almost 1960s. This classic 1950s sci-fi film is a must-see for fans, though not the best. The plot, reused in shows like Star Trek, holds interest. Trekkers may note its influence on Star Trek's original series but might be put off by mild sexism and lack of racial integration. Leslie Nielsen's performance is average; Walter Pigeon over-acts. Anne Francis, Earl Holliman, and Robby the Robot stand out. The featured performances' issues may stem from the director and editor, but overall, they got most of the film right.
I desperately want to give this piece of GARBAGE a zero, but I had to give it a 1 to warn you how terrible this cartoon is! The characters look like they were drawn by pre-schoolers—I've seen them do better! I prefer "Misadventures of Flapjack" to this awful cartoon! It's a RIP OFF! Remember Dexter's Lab's go-kart episode? Mister Fellows even stole that idea and failed! They also ripped off Shadow Lugia in a Pokemon parody episode! One character is a cheap Mandark rip-off! Mister Fellows should be sued for statutory infringement for this crap! If you like Johnny (RIP-OFF) Test, you're lying to yourself. Change the channel!
"Ecstasy" (1933) introduces 19-year-old Hedy Lamarr, marking the start of her legendary career. As Eva, Lamarr's character realizes her marital mistake on her wedding night. Director Gustav Machaty beautifully captures Lamarr's talents with silent, impactful scenes. The film was controversial for its time, featuring Lamarr as the first nude actress in a major film during a famous lake scene. Eva's adventure leads her to a new lover, with Machaty creating sensually daring moments. Lamarr's brave performance led to MGM fame. The film's unexpected turns make it compelling. Highly recommended for its story, direction, and Lamarr's stunning debut.
The movie's main plot had potential, but was overwhelmed by unnecessary subplots and undeveloped characters. Marketing likely dictated the multiple villains, double-crosses, and forced romance. The ending was incomplete and confusing, lacking explanations for characters' actions. It's surprising good actors joined this hollow movie. Feels like a student project; not worth your time unless it's for a film class example.
This is the worst film I've ever watched. I couldn't finish it. The writer seems obsessed with women peeing, puking, and crapping. I can't believe it was made, let alone that I paid £4 to rent it. Both picture and sound quality are terrible, and the acting is nonexistent. The scenes were reminiscent of "2 Girls 1 Cup." The girls seemed like they were cast just to take their tops off, and their shrieking was unbearable. It's like a bad amateur school production without direction, mainly set in a car. Definitely not worth buying. I'm sorry for the negativity, but there is nothing positive to say. I hope this saves someone else from wasting their money.
Perfect movies are rare, but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish. The script is brilliant, the acting superb (Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing), the directing and photography inspired, and the music touching without being intrusive. Every sad moment is truly moving, every light moment makes me smile. One of the best films I have ever seen. I wish Reese Witherspoon's recent movies were as serious and real as this one. Brilliant! A must-see.
The stereotyped portrayal of 'indians' in this story is just plain wrong. Elvis looks good but his skin color changes and the makeup is obvious. It's as bad as old Hollywood westerns with non-Native actors. The movie has a typical lame story and mediocre songs, emblematic of Elvis’ later films, which only happened due to Colonel Parker's contracts. Thankfully, Elvis stopped making movies soon after. It’s nice to see actors like Joan Blondell and Burgess Meredith, although Meredith's makeup is the worst. Despite the bad ones overwhelming the good, I’ll always love Elvis!
The movie was too long and too serious for a comedy, with scenes like a fiancé hitting his girlfriend and beatings. It dragged on, making me want to sleep. Reunion scenes, like the lady singing, felt out of place. Perry can do better.
This is the movie that made me love Michael Keaton. He does a great parody of James Cagney with charm to spare. The supporting cast is solid, delivering a fine job in this '80s comedy, a spoof of '30s-'40s gangster movies with original material. Joe Piscopo's warnings, Roman Moronie's English profanity, hilarious sight gags, and memorable lines make this film a must-watch. Maureen Stapleton's surprising gags add to the fun. If one gag doesn't hit, another will come in 30 seconds. Some minor flaws, but it's probably the best of spoofs.
The team did a great job with just £300,000 and 7 weeks to create this film, an achievement in itself. Despite its niche appeal (a young girl is killed and there is homo-eroticism), it's a heart-wrenching tragedy that deepens in sadness, especially for Heaton's unreturned love. It's one of my favorite British films, which I enjoyed and would watch again. It's a shame it's not well known.
Domino is a refreshing, unique film with an intricate plot, varied characters, and intense camera effects. Some critique the camera work, but it reflects how Domino sees things. Despite claims of a messy story, it's just fast-paced and easy to follow if you focus. The cast is excellent, portraying their characters effectively and offering glimpses into their lives. Overall, this is a great film, whether or not it becomes a cult classic.
"Once upon a time in France, people lived happily. Men reveled in war, and when more soldiers died than were enlisted, recruiters replenished the ranks. Fanfan (Gerard Philipe), escaping marriage by enlisting in the Regiment d'Aquitane, believes a gypsy's prophecy of fame and marrying the King's daughter. However, Adeline (Gina Lollobrigida), not a gypsy but the recruiter's daughter, captures his heart.   Fanfan's adventure is marked by rescues, swordfights, escapes from hangings, and romantic escapades. Gerard Philipe, a beloved stage and screen actor, performed most of his stunts and was admired by all. He tragically died at 36. Gina Lollobrigida shines as Adeline, captivating with her sharp and passionate portrayal.  The film thrives on satiric action and witty dialogue. Adeline's encounter with the king showcases clever and humorous exchanges. Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut criticized popular movies like this, missing its satirical take on war. Eventually, some, like Truffaut and Chabrol, recognized the value in well-made popular films.  Fanfan la Tulipe is a joyous satire with endless adventure and wit. Viva Fanfan!"
I wish I hadn't started the series. The final episode contradicted the last seven years and ruined everything. After a 23-year journey, Captain Janeway reduces it to seven years. Why not one or none? Why save Seven of Nine only? What about the others? The crew claims the journey is more important than the destination. Unbelievable. The finale shows ships and Earth in sight, but nothing about landing or returning to normal life. Worst ending ever.
There should be a sub-genre in the Western called 'the Robert Mitchum Western'. Mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic Westerns import his noir persona to create compellingly dark character sketches with an elegiac world-weariness, akin to Sam Peckinpah's films. 'Man with the Gun' is one of his best. Directed by Orson Welles protege Richard Wilson, it's a stark, monochrome beauty with chilling silhouettes and savage violence, as Mitchum tames a town terrorized by a monopolist. His transition from soft-spoken stranger to deranged murderer is a marvel of expressive, physical acting.
I loved it. During its run, it became a phenomenon. The Anorexic Twins became popular, Bob Saget started earning, and people knew Dave Coulier. It was humorous and always had a good lesson. I even liked the last few seasons as older children allowed for more script options. I gave it 8/10 for its wholesome, funny story lines, and Bob Saget!
The type of movie you could watch ten times and still enjoy its nuances. If this was Visconti's debut, it's astonishing to think how he might improve. I've also seen his "Death in Venice," which was visually more dazzling but not as involving as "Ossessione." The film features graceful camera movements, beautiful composition, terrific characters, and great story development, adapted from James M. Cain's "The Postman Always Rings Twice." Made in 1943, it predates Brando's realistic acting in "Streetcar Named Desire" (1951) and is electrifyingly sensual. Banned in fascist Italy and recut in America, it wasn't fully seen in the U.S. until 1959. One of the best, most beautiful, and exciting movies I've ever seen—highly recommended!
I am Black American and loved this soap opera. I watched it dubbed in Spanish on Telemundo 5-7 years ago. It’s based on the true story of a black slave whose love affair with a white commander led to her leadership. XICA saw her possibilities despite having nothing. Some say she sold out, but she aimed to secure her future and her children's. It was such a great soap opera that I expected a DVD release, but it's not available. It’s the best soap opera ever, and it should be released on DVD or broadcast again, preferably on Telemundo.
This film is in my top four of all time. James Cameron proves he's a master storyteller with films like Aliens, The Abyss, and Terminator. Titanic, though different, is exceptionally moving with surprises, plot development, and deep character growth. Despite the known story, Cameron makes it captivating. DiCaprio and Winslet deliver stellar performances, and the focus on their characters is purposeful. The film is emotionally satisfying, with iconic music from James Horner. The dialogue can be cheesy, but Cameron delivers a romantic epic. My heart won't go on from this one.
This is one of the worst movies ever. Shaq should stick to basketball. This movie wasted part of my life. I'll mock this movie forever. It's so horrible, it's not even funny. MST3000 would have a blast with it.
Ooof! This one was a stinker. It falls between the cracks of a Wham! video and Captain EO, but with a lower budget and more close-ups of crying teenagers. Simon Le Bon is front and center, while the band imitates Roxy Music. Brief clips from Barbarella add nothing. Avoid at all costs. I liked 'Hungry Like The Wolf,' but why was there a tiger in the audience? A DVD of Duran Duran's '80s videos might be worth a look for nostalgia.
This 1950's culture-clash movie features John Wayne in a surprisingly passive role, which he performs with style and subtlety. Despite his presence, he doesn't dominate the film, as the narrative is driven by the titular geisha. The story focuses on American attempts to engage with isolationist Japan through political intrigue rather than action. The film showcases well-choreographed ceremonies, authentic costumes, and props, with a balanced script and considerable Japanese dialogue. The fractured romance adds depth beyond political themes. Unlike other films of its time, the cast appears genuinely oriental. Overall, it's more enjoyable than 'The King And I' or 'Blood Alley', with a better script and less problematic elements. Recommended.
Harem Suare is the best film I saw in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Sensually shot and stunning, it's a bold film tackling interracial romance, a Hollywood taboo. Women of all shapes, sizes, and colors entertain each other with stories of intrigue, rivalry, and jealousy.
For a little-known film, this was pretty good. It's a modern-day British crime film that's quirky but not as wild as "Snatch." It has rough characters and a corny, predictable ending. Early on, there are neat twists making it interesting for first-time viewers. It's about a British man who gets a Russian "mail order bride" leading to big surprises. Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star and are very good, along with Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz. It's a different, well-acted film with Kidman proving she's more than just a beautiful face.
SCARECROW is a B-movie that's so bad, it's annoying to sit through. A bullied high school student is killed by his mom's lover and his soul transfers into a scarecrow that kills his bullies and teachers with snappy one-liners and Matrix-like flips. Despite two sequels, it's not even worth a laugh.
Kenneth Branagh's 'Hamlet' is the first full-text film version, making the play accessible without simplifying it. Set in a generic 19th-century European backdrop, the outstanding production design and cinematography support the four-hour runtime. The inspired casting includes superb performances from Derek Jacobi, Kate Winslet, Richard Briers, Nicholas Farrell, and others, although Jack Lemmon's performance felt off. Branagh's portrayal of Hamlet, while occasionally over-the-top, helps viewers grasp the character's thoughts and feelings, meriting at least an Oscar nomination. Despite slightly lengthy monologues, Branagh may have created the definitive film version of 'Hamlet.'
Roy Rogers and company revive "Sintown," a ghost town with potential silver mining success. Andy Devine ("Cookie") offers slapstick, and Jane Frazee (Carol) catches Rogers' eye. Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage replace Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers. James Finlayson adds to the slapstick, with a floorboard stealing the show and Devine's mule kicking. The human performances are energetic, but the material isn't impressive. ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
This movie is an hour and a half of confusion with unlikable characters and a non-existent script. The "Victorian story" has no dialogue, just shots of a guy staring at a girl. The story involves a guy telling about dead girls, but it’s filled with awkward dialogue and plot holes. The characters are unlikable, and the deaths are depicted poorly. The storyteller's knowledge of events is baffling and the movie ends pointlessly. Overall, it's stupid, pointless, and full of plot holes. "Hell's Threshold" deserves 2/10.
A trail boss loses his cattle herd to a crooked lawman and ends up in the Yukon gold fields with a tarnished reputation. His luck improves until an old adversary resurfaces. Good western with many familiar faces.
Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is a mob boss released from a mental hospital. His fellow criminals, including volatile "Brass Balls" Ben (Gabriel Byrne), smarmy Jake Parker (Kyle MacLachlan), and rival "Wacky" Jacky Jackson (Burt Reynolds), all try to kill him. Hit-man Mickey Holliday (Jeff Goldblum) gets caught in the chaos. Writer/director Larry Bishop creates a dark, quirky comedy about betrayal and ambition. The cast, featuring Ellen Barkin, Henry Silva, Gregory Hines, Diane Lane, Billy Drago, and Christopher Jones, delivers colorful performances. Cameos include Billy Idol, Michael J. Pollard, Joey Bishop, Rob Reiner, and Richard Pryor. Byrne's duet with Paul Anka on "My Way" is a highlight, and a climactic Mexican stand-off is amusing. Frank Byers' cinematography, nutty dialogue, Earl Rose's jazzy score, and a choice vintage soundtrack enhance this entertaining film.
Even though it bombed at the box office, this is my favorite film with a powerful family message. It has violence, a song with girls in bikinis, and more realistic action scenes compared to other Bollywood films. Featuring Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan, Amitabh embodies the Indian Godfather. Critics' reviews are ignorant; this film offers a great mix of comedy, romance, drama, and action. For more realistic action than Main Hoon Na, watch this movie.
As a Burt Reynolds fan, I'm disappointed. The dialogue is laughable, and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes. I can't believe he even made this one. Is he that hard up for money?
Are you kidding? That was awful! The film starts OK but goes downhill from the middle. The ending is one of the most anti-climactic in recent history. Lots of gore in the end sequence; if you like schlock horror, this is for you.... 3/10
Hedy Lamarr, known for her beauty, stars in this 1932/3 classic film. Despite brief nudity, director Gustav Machaty employs artistic techniques to maintain modesty. The film is noted for its imagery, expressionism, and minimal dialogue, instead relying on visual storytelling. The plot centers around Eva, trapped in a loveless marriage with an older man, who finds love with an engineer after a chance encounter. The film's sound quality reflects its age, but it remains a lyrical piece worthy of appreciation. I rated it 7/10.
This docudrama explores the Lindy Chamberlain case and its impact on Australian society, highlighting issues of innuendo, gossip, and emotional expectations in real-life dramas. It challenges the notion that everyone should respond to crises with melodramatic hysteria, pointing out the unrealistic expectations often perpetuated by media. The leads and supporting cast, including many known for comedy, deliver performances filled with depth and sensitivity. As an ex-Adventist who was in Australia during the incident, I find the story handled with creativity, personality, and emotional heart, particularly the scene where the couple is pursued by news choppers. Director Fred Schepsi's advice to the actors to "play the best case for their character" is especially fitting for this story and should be a general principle in acting.
A classy shoot with whimsical music, "Love in the Time of Money" explores a chain of relationships from person A to person B, and so on, ending where it began. It delicately examines the unhappy lives of nine people, starting and ending with a street whore and her client. Despite lacking a strong story, which critics noted, it kept me captivated unlike "Angels in America." Use caution; I might be the only one who really liked it.
I expected a comedy like "Big Mama," but got a bizarre mix of comedy, drama, and a love story. The movie has three plots: Madea taking in a foster child, a woman abused by her rich fiancé, and a single mother and father relationship. There's little comedy and many twisted messages, like Madea beating the foster child into good behavior. It covers child rape and inappropriate ogling at a family reunion, making it confusing: comedy, love story, or drama? Ultimately, it's a waste of time and money.
This waste of production money proves the rich and famous can be as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From a silly Tennessee Williams play, directed poorly by Joseph Losey, and starring Taylor, Burton, and Coward, this project filmed in a Mediterranean mansion seemed a sure winner in 1967. The result is absurdly tedious. The visuals are spectacular due to the setting and real home, but Taylor's screeching, Burton's half-asleep wanderings, loony dialogue, Coward laughing at himself, ridiculous story and plot devices, and absurd costuming irritate. BOOM is a disgrace, wasting money and talent, proving famous people can be idiots. Not even fun—just terrible.
I have been a fan of Pushing Daisies from the start. Bryan Fuller has remarkable ideas for this wonderfully original show. It’s a huge relief to see something so creative on TV, unlike many similar shows. With a magnificent cast, wonderful script, and constant hilarity, Pushing Daisies is one of the most remarkable shows on television.
The show is based on Geico commercials, which were amusing at first but not suited for a series. ABC even bought the rights from Geico, though cavemen in modern times isn't unique—SNL's Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer did it well as a recurring sketch. As a regular series, it fails. Another similar concept, "It's About Time," only lasted one season in the 1960s. A director from the commercials believed they had unique, bigger stories to tell, but he was wrong. This show will be remembered as one of the worst, like 1972's "Me and the Chimp," and likely lead to the actors going into hiding from shame.
Born Again is an okay episode. The reincarnation bit is cool. The more I watch it, the more I like it, but it will never be more than 'Very Good'. It’s not very memorable, but I’ll remember it as the reincarnation episode.  The Good:  - Origami - Nice fish tank  - Thrown out of a window  The Bad: - Marrying your best friend's wife - Random reincarnation choice - Why didn’t the guy try to take his scarf off?  Conclusion: Okay episode, not very memorable. 7/10
A swarthy man has a realistic nightmare during the opening credits. The film follows a woman into a grungy club in dystopic 2054 Paris, where she argues with a Slavic bartender over money. Another woman intervenes, leading to a fight. The woman is kidnapped, setting off the story of Karas, a hard-boiled cop. Renaissance tells a classic detective story in stark monochrome without the usual gray shades, creating a harsh vision of a commercialized future. The characters appear like they’re from a Gothic comic but move with clear humanity. Unlike other animated films, Renaissance doesn't let technical advances overshadow the story. Despite its narrative conventions and adequate voice-over cast, it feels like true noir and prompts deeper thought about life's tragedies and meaning.
This is a strange, poorly assembled film with stilted acting and a nonsensical plot. It seems the bond company took over, resulting in missing footage and cheap, ill-fitting music. Very odd. I might buy the DVD to understand what happened.
Jackie (Erica Gavin) is sent to prison for 10-40 years for drugs and refusing to give up accomplices. She tries to adjust to life in the 'doll' house in this Jonathan Demme film. Despite its tawdry nature, it's highly watchable, ranking just below "Silence of the Lambs" and "Stop Making Sense" but far above his other movies. This minor classic is campy and fun, avoiding parody of the Women In Prison genre. However, it has downfalls like the long 'un'talent show and wasted talent like Barbera Steele. Still, it's an enjoyable movie overall.  Grade: B-  DVD Extras: 5-minute Roger Corman interview, cast & crew bios, original trailer, and trailers for "Candy Stripe Nurses," "Big Bad Mama 2," "Big Doll House," and "Crazy Mama."  Eye Candy: Juanita Brown, Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith, Erica Gavin, Roberta Collins, Ella Reid, Lynda Gold, and others show skin.
FORBIDDEN PLANET is a prime example of classic Hollywood SF films, influential for over a decade. While some elements and pacing have dated, the central idea of the Krell civilization and "monsters from the Id" remains compelling. However, the current DVD quality is poor, and a restoration is needed for this SF classic.
Alice (Danes) and Darlene (Beckinsale) are close friends who decide to go to Bangkok instead of Hawaii, only to get busted for smuggling drugs. The film explores their survival and the strength of their friendship. "Brokedown Palace" is a good film with strong acting, particularly from Danes and Beckinsale. The prison scenes, although less brutal than expected, reflect the hopelessness of their situation. Kaplan’s direction and the soundtrack enhance the mood, especially Sara McLachlan's haunting voice. However, the girls' poor decisions and the less severe prison conditions are drawbacks. Overall, the film effectively questions the lengths one would go for a friend.
Robert Mitchum stars as Clint Tollinger in "Man With The Gun." Tollinger is a professional town tamer, hired to save towns in trouble. He arrives in town by accident while looking for a former fling and finds it controlled by a gangster. His methods strain the townspeople, making "High Plains Drifter" seem less original. The film starts as a typical western but becomes surprisingly dark and character-driven. It is well-shot, the cast is enjoyable, and Mitchum delivers his effective tough-guy presence. "Man With The Gun" is a worthwhile Mitchum western.
The original Thunderbirds earned a place in TV history, beloved by kids and adults. In the original, the Thunderbirds heroically rescued people, inspiring imagination. This movie, however, was a crass attempt at a kids' film, merging Thunderbirds with Loony Tunes. Anthony Edwards as Brain stuttering like Porky Pig? Kung Fu/Power Rangers fighting? The tech that inspired us was missing, replaced by a new, unoriginal plot. TinTin had mystical powers and The Hood mimicked "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." The heart of Thunderbirds was gone. Ron Cook's Parker was great, but Lady Penelope felt childish. Fans were disappointed as it failed to meet expectations. If it's a kids' movie, send it straight to video rather than misleading fans.
This is a terrible British remake of the U.S. movie "Wide Awake." While "Wide Awake" is strange but entertaining and funny, "Liam" is just strange. However, "Liam" did confirm that I made the right choice in changing my religion!
I saw this film at the NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and thought it was bad. It had distracting slow motion and arty close-ups that seemed pointless. The film felt pretentious. The lead actor, Sam Levine, was cute but mediocre, and the rest of the cast ranged from so-so to bad. The story was mostly predictable. Though most of the audience enjoyed it, I disliked it a lot.
This movie is definitely a B-Grade film, but since even the creators know it's not credible, it can be forgiven. The plot involves a convicted psycho killer whose genetic material mixes with experimental acid and gets lost in the snow, turning him into a snowman named Jack Frost. He seeks revenge on the sheriff who jailed him, killing half the town in the process. The movie lacks real scares and has effects reminiscent of 1950s B-Grade films, making it worth a watch for a laugh. A good way to pass the time.
Question: I am Curious (Yellow) was a major art-house sensation and scandal, taken to the U.S. Supreme Court due to explicit content. The film mixes politics, sex, and an exploration of Swedish society with a 'metafilm' style. Lena and Borje's hot-cold relationship and Lena's socialist ambitions are interwoven with Sjoman's self-insertion as the director. The film's playful structure demands attention, blending narrative, documentary, and interviews, including with Martin Luther King. It's intellectually stimulating but less emotionally engaging compared to Bergman, with performances by Lena Nyman and Borje Ahlstedt standing out. Despite its flaws, I Am Curious (Yellow) remains an influential artistic experiment in Swedish cinema, notable for its provocative and comedic use of meta-filmmaking techniques.
This movie pretends to be a social commentary but is as ridiculous as the racism it condemns. It portrays African-Americans as strong and other races as weak. Rapaport pulls a gun on Omar Epps and a Jewish guy; the Jewish guy pleads in fear, while Epps stands strong. Fraternity members are depicted as arrogant drunks or rapists, and a raped white girl considers lesbianism because she's portrayed as weak. The rejected nerdy white guy joins cowardly skinheads, and Busta Rhymes unrealistically beats a guy twice his size. Black men never reject their own, and Omar Epps moves in easily. Ice Cube's scenes threatening white roommates are stupid, with white guys living in fear and eventually moving out. The ending is laughably bad with overly dramatic slow-motion faces. Skip this movie.
Probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The editing, sound effects, and sound editing were awful. Most of the time, all you could hear were bad kicking effects and muddled talking. I had to turn the volume up to full just to hear anything, and even then, the script was terrible. I can't believe someone financed this film. Dolph was just Dolph. The villains, protagonists, and the whole movie were bad. If you want to know what not to do in making a movie, watch this!
Solar Crisis (Crisis 2050) is a 1990 sci-fi film about a mission to the Sun to prevent a solar flare catastrophe. Despite a high budget, it flopped, going straight to video in a re-edited Alan Smithee version. Jack Palance, Charlton Heston, and Tim Matheson lead a cast that delivers dull performances, mostly standing still and looking at screens. The movie lacks urgency, momentum, and logic, making it a tedious watch. Highlights include a talking bomb voiced by Paul Williams and brief moments of camp, but overall, it’s a painfully inert film. The Earth scenes with Palance and Nemec add little, making the entire film a boring experience. The director Richard C. Sarafian's original cut is slightly longer but equally unimpressive. A film so bad it’s not even amusingly bad.
"This Is Not A Love Song" effectively explores the chase genre, hinting at a deeper connection between Heaton and Spike. Heaton's love for Spike is evident in intimate scenes like the blow back and letter writing. Negative reviews often miss Heaton's potential romantic feelings for Spike and sometimes use derogatory language, indicating a lack of understanding. Despite being intense and character-driven, I enjoyed this film, though it may not appeal to everyone.
I've seen most Laurel & Hardy classics and love their comedy, even on repeat viewings. This new film with look-alike actors fails badly. Their early 20th-century clothes clash with the 90s setting, and recycled dialogue falls flat. It might be the worst film ever and should be shelved forever. The real Laurel & Hardy would be horrified by this poor imitation.
I enjoyed this movie. The adult actors were great, though the main kid was a bit stiff but promising. The humor is subtle and not over-the-top. It's slower-paced, so not for those with short attention spans. The Blu-ray quality is excellent, and the extras were cool, despite many deleted scenes that didn't add much.
For a film both 'him' and 'her' will enjoy, pick this one. I'm a rom-com fan, unlike my husband, but he loved it after I mentioned it involved sports! Drew Barrymore is hilarious, and her co-star is equally good. Originally called 'The Perfect Match,' it was renamed due to a previous UK film with the same title. Trust me, girls, get your partner to watch this on a Saturday night; you'll both laugh and cry. A real gem.
This film is excellent but may not appeal to the masses. It requires active participation, observation, thinking, and questioning. Comparable to Deliverance in theme and The Blair Witch Project in style, it remains unique. Effective cinematography enhances the story's tension. Acting is raw, menacing, and believable. The film's true theme is friendship, as suggested by the title. It is a love song.
The movie had some boring scenes but the women cast, particularly Krista Allen, outshined the males. Krista's performance and voice were captivating, especially in the bed scenes, and she was impressive as the baddie. Burt Reynolds did not perform well and seemed to be in it for the money.
Worldwide was a cheaper version of NWA's 1980s shows. When Ted Turner acquired the failing NWA, he created WCW, dropped NWA references, and rebranded NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling as WCW, moving them to Disney/MGM Studios. These shows became recaps for WCW's Nitro, Thunder, and Saturday Night. Worldwide was the last WCW program to air before Vince McMahon and WWF bought it. Today, the NWA World Wide/WCW Worldwide Video Tape Archive and the entire NWA/WCW Video Tape Library are in WWE's vaults in Stamford, Connecticut.
"Holly" has a factual basis that moved me, but the movie itself did not quite work. I look forward to the documentary by the producers, which I think will be more compelling. The international cast of B-class actors was appropriate, with a special mention for the young actress who played Holly in her first challenging role. Ron Livingston was adequate but bland as Patrick, and Chris Penn was good in his final role. Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier were forgettable. Despite believing in the film's message and intention, I rate "Holly" 3 stars for its shortcomings. The subject is important, and I hope the documentary debuts on BBC and other networks.
SEX WISH, released in the UK during the video boom, sparked controversy for allegedly inspiring a copycat murder but was overshadowed by less extreme films. Watching it on DVD-RW, I found it demented and shockingly violent, akin to a triple-X DEATH WISH with hardcore sex and 70s sleaze. Highlights include a disturbing vibrator scene, Harry Reems's memorable moustache, a harrowing scene with a young black couple, and surprisingly slick direction. If you think the past was innocent, SEX WISH will prove you wrong.
Eytan Fox, known for films like "Walk on Water" and "Yossi & Jagger," takes an extreme and unfair approach in "The Bubble." Unlike past screenings, the audience quietly left, and I was furious at its one-sided depiction of Israelis as racist bullies and Arabs as justified in their terrorism. This film felt like an Israeli version of "Paradise Now" and not worth the ticket price. It promotes anti-Israeli beliefs and is disappointing, especially coming from a talented Israeli director. What a shameful, horrid film!
I'm generally open-minded about rom coms, but this was not a good attempt. It's unrelated to comparisons with the British original, which I haven't seen. The issues are a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between leads, and a terrible performance/character from Jimmy Fallon. Fallon acts immature and unbelievable as a teacher. The character is so irrational that even seasoned actors like John Cusack or Adam Sandler would struggle, but Fallon is neither funny nor a convincing actor. The film fails to make the relationship between the leads believable. Near the end, Barrymore's character breaks up with Fallon's, evoking relief rather than sympathy. But the plot forces a gooey, unsatisfying reunion, leaving me more disgusted than anything else.
I was excited by the ads because I enjoyed the book, but the movie disappointed me. The characters didn't fit well, the direction was weak, and it was hard to connect with them. The dialog was inadequate and the film felt rushed. Overall, very disappointing. If you haven't read the book, the movie might be okay and could encourage you to read the book, which is much better.
This is a good movie. It's fun to see money being spent rapidly from a kid's viewpoint. It's a fun movie about a kid's dream coming true and what they'd do with $1 million. If you don't like it, don't watch it. Movies are made for viewers, not complainers.
This movie is great if you consider its release time. Though outdated, it left a lasting impression on me and my friends for over twenty years. Watching it again on DVD brought some disappointment, partly due to our naivety and partly due to technical flaws. Despite this, the movie's focus on mutilation over death and its constant morbid atmosphere make it a standout, especially for modern horror filmmakers. A remake with improved technical aspects could be worthwhile, but the black-and-white tones should remain.
This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's terrible but so good! Don't expect a gripping plot or something clever and entertaining, as you'll be disappointed. But if you want to see 50 million vases and Goro's fantastic hair/bad English, it's a treat. The more you think about it, the worse it gets, unless you enjoy spotting plot holes. I'd only recommend this for the bored or die-hard Smap fans, though Goro's Japanese fans were upset, thinking he sold out (he didn't; Johnny Kitagawa, the executive producer, did).
This movie offered nothing new. My wife and I agreed it was churned out without care for entertainment. It’s a "concept only" film, relying on its concept to make money. The movie starts with Cruella on parole, adoring puppies, but soon reverts to her old ways.  The supporting characters were annoying. Eric Idle as Waddlesworth was unbearable, despite being a Python fan. Tim McInnerny was wasted and unfunny, unlike in Black Adder. Gérard Depardieu was also wasted. Other poorly written characters are forgettable.  Overall, it’s better to let your kids watch TV than this.
Aside from his "Tarzan" series, Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote many books, though few were filmed, like "The Lad and the Lion," adapted as "The Lion Man" (1936). The movie, despite real desert locations, is slow, jerky, and dull. Characters appear and disappear abruptly, some uncredited despite memorable roles. The credited actors generally fare worse, except for Finis Barton as a kidnapped harem girl. The cast struggles with poor dialogue, which should have been delivered tongue-in-cheek. Director J.P. McCarthy might be to blame. Kathleen Burke's talent is wasted alongside Richard Carlyle and Jon Hall. Hall's delivery is marginally better than Carlyle's, but that's no endorsement.
Bad script, bad direction, over-the-top performances, and overwrought dialogue make this unintentionally hilarious. Zadora's over-acting and cliched scenarios create a parody of the "Hollywood" machine, almost as funny as "Spinal Tap." Don't miss Ray Liotta's debut line, "Looks like a penis."
I regret buying this series. I expected more action, an objective view, and consistency. Instead, it's pure propaganda, dark, and boring with weak acting. O'Donnell, charming as Robin, lacks charm here. Unsurprisingly, it wasn't shown in many countries, sold in the UK at 40% off, and not released in the Netherlands.
The worst movie in cinema history. It was unwatchable, failing to be funny, sad, poignant, or droll. Everyone involved, from Key Grip to Robin Williams, should be ashamed!
Starts well with a nice intro but loses charm after 5 minutes. The protagonist resembles the one from American Pie but lacks the supporting cast or innovative storyline. Heder's poor acting doesn't help, and while Keaton, Daniels, and Faris try, there's no substantial plot. The movie plods with no pace or coherent storyline. The ending is very predictable. Avoid unless you have absolutely nothing else to do; you'll feel cheated out of an hour and a half.
Buster shines in this episode, the only late-career work showcasing his renowned physical (and silent) comedy. Hearing his gravelly voice in talkie sequences is jarring, but his pratfall skills remain unmatched. He even repeats early gags from his work with Roscoe Arbuckle. Thanks to Rod Serling for this episode, a touching tribute to Buster's genius, even in a short format.
Monika Mitchell's showbiz satire offers laughs and planned violence, with insult and injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini), a quirky character actor, consistently loses roles to producers' nephews or trivial reasons. Obsessed, Max decides to eliminate the competition. A rewarding career is within reach with this mindset. The cast includes Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini, and cameos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. That's show business—or is it?
I saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and we found it ridiculously pitiful. Stallone's pointless gear aside, the film mistakes the Dolomites in Italy for Colorado. Hollywood feeds viewers more absurd content like this.
This movie was full of endless surprises! Just when you thought it couldn't get worse, they added more joints and pink fuzzy-lined vans with raunchy sex scenes. We were tricked into watching it thinking it was Supervan, which promised lasers, jailbreaks, and more. Who knew a Dollar Store Christmas present could be so much fun!
Leonard Maltin's review is off; the movie starts tepid and then catches fire. The simple plot follows a family on vacation: Dad is injured, Mom seeks help, and meets a dangerous convict. Mom manipulates the convict to help while Dad waits. Ralph Meeker's surprise appearance as the cunning criminal electrifies the film, with a flippant, reckless performance. His character adds humor, especially in interactions with hostage Barbara Stanwyck. Despite some ridiculous flaws, like a police evasion scene, the film is a sturdy thriller with an exciting conclusion.
A lonely French boy, Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim), meets and falls in love with Cedric (Stephane Rideau) during a summer vacation. The film is quiet and slow, and although I felt for the characters, the constant flashbacks made it confusing. There are plot holes: Mathieu ends up in the hospital, breaks up with Cedric but tells others he’s living with him, and hooks up with another guy without explanation. Elkaim is handsome but lacks acting skills, whereas Rideau is a great actor with strong sexual magnetism. The movie features full frontal nudity and explicit male-male love scenes, which enhance the characters' connection. Overall, it’s a frustrating but somewhat worthwhile film, especially for Rideau’s nude scenes.
The story is interesting, focusing on late 20th-century slavery from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem is the apparent bias against Arabs and Germans by the director, Richard Fleisher. The depiction of Arabs freely catching Blacks and the sole German buyer is unrealistic and shows clear bias. Despite this, the acting is above average, especially Peter Ustinov and Kabir Bedi, with Michael Caine also performing well.
This film transports you to a time with a different pace of life, showing how families coped with war and how quickly young men were sent to fight. It’s a touching look at the past, reminding us that war casualties occur off the front as well. For many, it's a small thank you to those who endured wars. Peter Outerbridge resembles a young Peter O'Toole, and Russell Crowe is charming and distinctly Australian. Hearing Crowe recite "High Flight" sparks curiosity about his potential with Shakespeare.
The title overstates the movie's content, suggesting more panic than is shown. Few people know about the murderer spreading the plague. Despite this, the story has high suspense, skillfully built by director Elia Kazan. The evolving relationship between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas) is a highlight, starting from mutual dislike to respect. Performances were excellent, especially Widmark, Douglas, and Jack Palance. Barbara Bel Geddes was a bit flat as Nancy, but her role was minor. Overall, an excellent film. 9/10
Until the 1990s there had never been a film based on Jane Austen's "Emma". Then two came in 1996, or three if you count 1995's "Clueless". The main character, Emma Woodhouse, is a young lady from a wealthy family who enjoys matchmaking. She convinces her friend Harriet to reject a proposal from Robert Martin in favor of Mr. Elton, who ends up falling for Emma. Emma rejects Elton, leading to complications and eventually her own love story.   In 2008 Kate Beckinsale is a star, but in 1996 she was less known than Gwyneth Paltrow. Beckinsale is convincing as Emma, showing talent for classical roles, unlike in "Pearl Harbor" or "Underworld".   Jeremy Northam, as Mr. Knightley, fits my conception of a gentlemanly mentor better than Mark Strong, who plays him more as a passionate lover. Samantha Morton is more like the novel's Harriet than Toni Collette.  This TV version is smaller in scale compared to the cinema version, with less lavish sets and fewer big names, but British TV does costume drama well. Both versions are entertaining and well-made. 7/10
There's a good movie idea here, but this isn't it. The basic idea is to explore the moral issues facing young apocalypse survivors, but the logic is muddled. The heroes are paranoid about the contagion but inconsistently wear masks and clean surfaces. Despite weeks or months surviving, they act inexperienced, lacking proper equipment and failing to take precautions. Their squeamishness and illogical actions make their moral dilemmas hard to take seriously. Chris Pine's acting appears limited, repeating his arrogant character type. Although the film looks excellent with its sharp, saturated visuals, the weak writing and characters make it not worth watching. Save yourself the agony, even if you like the end-of-the-world genre.
In this dark film, a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for money, losing his mirror image in return—a metaphor for "a man at war with himself." Enjoying his wealth, he's forever cut off from love. Haunted by his double, he's isolated from human society, symbolized by his flight to a wasteland. Incredible scenes and intertitles beautifully express this doom. Paul Wegener, an amazing actor and director, shines. Understanding German history and doppelganger tradition enhances the experience. Despite its early film clumsiness, its tragic finale makes it one of the best ever.
Half Past Dead 2 is a direct-to-video sequel, less entertaining than the first but worth a look for action movie fans, WWE stars on screen, or sequel lovers. Kurupt performed well, Bill Goldberg was below average, and the rest of the cast did alright. The production by Sony wasn't great; cinematography was poor, and direction was acceptable. Watch it if you want; you won't lose anything either way.
Antwone Fisher, based on the autobiography "Finding Fish," is Denzel Washington's first directorial effort. The film portrays Antwone's (Derek Luke) painful journey from a troubled past to living in the present. Ordered to therapy after several outbursts, Antwone recounts his traumatic childhood in sessions with Navy Psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). Raised in a foster home where he faced humiliation and abuse, Antwone finds support in his therapist and girlfriend Cheryl (Joy Bryant), helping him build self-esteem and confront his past. The film stands out due to the strong performances of Washington and Luke, despite its somewhat formulaic approach. Derek Luke's portrayal of Antwone’s longing for acceptance is particularly moving. Antwone Fisher speaks to those who have longed for love and belonging.
Water Lilies, a French film about young female sexuality and friendship, focuses on three middle-class teenage girls in a Paris suburb, revolving around an indoor swimming pool where two are on a synchronized water ballet team. The story centers on the sullen Marie (Pauline Acquart), who idolizes Floriane (Adèle Haenel), a standout on the team pursued by boys. Marie drifts from her former best friend, the plump Anne (Louise Blachère), who is more accessible to boys. Floriane uses Marie as a cover for her assignations and later as a confidante. While Floriane is trapped by her need for male validation, Anne struggles with her body image and desires. The film's focus on their interactions showcases subtle shifts in their goals and dynamics, with moments of humor and offbeat scenes adding life. There’s no dramatic revelation, but it becomes clear that Marie desires Floriane and is jealous of her boyfriends. In typical irony, Floriane wants her first real sex with Marie, but Marie holds off, knowing it's more meaningful to her. Meanwhile, Anne's crush on male swimmer Francois is complicated by his interest in Floriane. Boys, though present, remain peripheral.
Pierce Brosnan, best known as Bond, and Annie Galipeau are miscast in this film about the Canadian wilderness. While Brosnan is more convincing, Galipeau struggles with poorly-written dialogue. The film's photography is pretty but lacks the grit of wilderness life, and Galipeau's portrayal is unconvincing and too picture-perfect for the setting. The 1930s period is poorly evoked due to a lackluster script by William Nicholson. Despite its environmental message, the film's potential is mishandled and feels ill-conceived. It fails to deliver a compelling story, hiding behind its "politically correct" stance.
As a big fan of Ashley Judd, I was curious about her debut role. Her talent and performance are excellent, and I see why critics liked the story's aesthetics. However, I found the movie failed to entertain. By halfway, I was bored watching a shop girl idly rearranging merchandise, expecting a dynamic event that never came. The story remained bland and uneventful. I'm not an action-junkie and usually enjoy various genres, especially romantic-comedies, but I expect entertainment. The cinematography and sound quality were like bad home movies. Depressing! Zero-entertainment value. The longest 114 minutes of my life.
This movie was banned in England? Why? Savini, Romero, Argento, Fulci, and others have done worse. It has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80s horror film: good looking girls who can't act, a terrible storm, a scythe, a crazy brother, and a good twist at the end. Banned? Really. When England banned this, Italians must have laughed at how backward and prudish the Brits were.  There’s maybe two minutes of violence and gore (underdone) and some nudity but no sex—nothing worthy of being banned. I'd like to see what could have been done with a better budget. Entertaining, but poor picture and sound quality take away from it. Banned? What a joke.
This film, surrounded by scandal and hype, ultimately disappoints. It fails as a comedy, horror, and erotic film. The 2-disc DVD has a beautiful booklet and director interview. Disc 1's edited film is in English with good visuals, while Disc 2's director's cut has poor quality in French. The creature is laughably ineffective.
The Hills Have Eyes II is pure entertainment and nothing more. The plot follows National Guard trainees battling mutated hillbillies, with a lot of violence and a pointless graphic rape scene. I’d give it 4 out of 10 because, despite the gore and jump scenes, it drags and feels repetitive. It’s decent if you’re bored. 4/10
Basically the same movie with a messed-up timeline, likely due to laziness. It's a real dud, undeserving of being called a movie. I saw it as a second feature with the original The Boogeyman and felt like my head would explode. Avoid it at all costs; it should come with a warning about lowering your IQ. Definitely a 0/10.
I've enjoyed many of Guy Maddin's films, but this one gave me a headache. John Gurdebeke's frenetic editing disrupts the actors' communication, despite an impressive sequence of heads snapping to one object. The film feels more brutal than Maddin's earlier works, lacking his usual sympathy for characters and leaning towards harshness for its own sake. The actor playing "Guy Maddin" does mimic his facial expressions well.
The 1939 film, directed by Ray Enright, pales in comparison to Michael Curtiz's "Angels with Dirty Faces". Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan's chemistry is its main highlight. The Dead End kids play major roles, overshadowing older characters. Notable is the use of arson, reflecting unscrupulous practices of landlords later in New York. Today's issues with guns make the youthful pranksters of the story seem tame by comparison.
I enjoy Dolph Lundgren for showing that hard work can lead to success. Despite negative reviews, Detention has positives like killing off annoying teenagers. The movie uses stereotypical teen characters: the angry black guy, the nerd, the slutty pregnant girl, the anti-social white kid, and the cool black kid, plus some expendable teens. Detention's plot and dialogue are bad. The villains steal a van full of drugs but only make out in it and never repaint or move the drugs. They irrationally decide to kill the kids and teacher even though no one else is aware of the hijacking. The villains, armed with machine guns, miss their targets most of the time, leading to a lot of pointless shooting. The stunts are poor. The supposed $10 million budget is surprising, as the film seems like a low-effort project Lundgren did for a film school. Watching it was a test, but I passed.
I saw this movie as a kid and felt ripped off by a good commercial. The commercial included all the explosions and special effects (about 4) and even some not in the movie. The plot involved aliens, but I don't remember seeing them. It seemed designed to scam people. My innocence ended when I realized bad people make bad movies.
I hated the glorification of being a bounty hunter, the sexism disguised as an interesting female lead, the bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints, and the misuse of Lucy Lui. The rapid-fire editing and echoing dialogue, with Keira Knightley as a ridiculous bounty hunter, were unbearable. Nobody earns credibility from this painful and misguided film that tries to mimic Natural Born Killers and fails. Is it supposed to be a comedy? The opening "Based on a true story...sort of" is a cop-out. The film distorts Domino Harvey's life, making her a caricature. The action starts with the leads as unlikeable, violent intruders, making the audience question their actions and intentions. The film is excruciating, with bad performances and a nonsensical plot involving fake I.Ds and implausible scenes. It ends with a dumb climax, distasteful jokes, and a sad attempt at comedy, leaving me depressed at its existence.
I viewed this movie early and expected it to be boring. It didn't improve on the 1984 Bachelor Party. It had funny moments but didn't really hit the mark for me. Acting was OK, and the storyline followed the original but could have been better. Aimed at teens, it's full of female bodies, alcohol, and sex, making it a typical party movie rehash. I rate it 4/10.
HUSBANDS BEWARE, a remake of BRIDELESS GROOM, starts with a great new cooking scene. The stooges are always funny cooking, but after a few minutes, it cuts to original footage from BRIDELESS GROOM. The 1953-1956 remakes fit the new story, using insert shots if needed. HUSBANDS BEWARE has a new ending, but I won't spoil it. **** out of 4 stars.
Bravo "The Spaz"! This movie is a farce, especially for a student film. Hats off to the Spazz for finding and commenting on such a rare picture. The movie has a thin, silly storyline. Why hire such bad actresses and have the director act, write, produce, and edit? It's a shame because he made a good movie before. Thanks to the Spazz for exposing this film.
We should send every copy of this film to Iraq and make them watch. I tried to get a blind woman to watch it and she turned it off in 20 min. Adam Sandler couldn't find a better project? The writing is awful, and those responsible should watch it forever in Hell! I read the budget was $10,000, but they were way under. Did Walmart get a good deal? Every store has a bin of this crap. The only good thing is using the DVD as a coaster or trading it to a friend, but then they might not be your friend anymore!
Never viewed this film, but it's a great classic with veteran actors. Set in a different era, there was no TV, just radio, and early Hollywood films. Sweet, innocent tales of young romance were seen differently. Ann Shirley, "Murder My Sweet" ('44), played an orphan called Carrot Top, taken in by two elderly folks. In this small town, everyone knew each other, and news spread quickly. It's a down-to-earth film with nice people helping each other. Though it seems corny today, it reflects the simple lifestyle of America in the 1920s & 30s, a generation that loved family films.
Douglas Sirk's "Written on the Wind," his paramount work, is captivating in every vivid frame. The famous opening, with wind-blown leaves and a calendar flashback, packs 99 minutes with familial drama akin to TV soaps like "Dallas" or "Dynasty." Rich and dysfunctional siblings Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, heirs to the Hadly oil fortune, create turmoil, while friends Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall attempt to stabilize. Based on Libby Holmann's story, Malone's Oscar-winning role as a troubled nymphomaniac shines with powerful lines. Hudson and Bacall, though solid, are overshadowed. Sirk masterfully crafts a melodramatic, decadent vision of late-50s America—none do it better.
This movie is horrendous. Despite decent fight scenes, the acting is incredibly bad, with painful line delivery and awkward interactions. The plot set-up and poorly executed irreverent cutaways resemble a high school production. The fight scenes, while not the worst, feel overly staged with many cuts. Overall, the only reason to watch is if you're friends with the main guy, who wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this low-quality film.
Roman Maroni, Johnny Dangerously's rival, hilariously butchers the English language. An underrated classic often found on late shows, Johnny Dangerously follows a good-hearted boy leading a life of crime to support his family. The cast, including Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner, and Alan Hale Jr, ensures constant entertainment. Like Airplane, it’s packed with laughs that you might miss if you’re not attentive. Highly recommended for a good laugh!
Like 'The Wizard of Oz,' Paris is in black-and-white and the Riviera in color. It's supposedly about possessive love, destructiveness, and moral decadence, but in reality, it focuses on designer gowns, Riviera shots, expensive cars, and Vincente Minnelli-like interludes. Watchable, but the dark plot and glitzy style diverge. (Was this the model for 'The Talented Mister Ripley? Any affinity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
I wasted £10 on SS's new movie Attack Force. Expecting cool martial arts, I got an old, bloated Segal, a ludicrous plot, and dire acting. His voice was poorly dubbed, switching between him and a Honda ad voice-over. The plot's typical, with cannon fodder characters and stereotyped bad guys. Avoid this film like a speeding train or H5N1 flu. Utter garbage. 1/10.
The makers did a terrific job of involving you with the characters as they suffered. The horrific scene in the woods was so superbly done that you forget these men were actors. I have never been so immersed in a film. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were at their best, along with great performances from Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney, and James Dickey. It is somewhat disturbing, so kids should be shielded, but this is great dramatic cinema.
My dad taped this movie for me when I was 3. By age 5, I had watched it over 400 times. It has a grim storyline: a lamb's mother is killed by a wolf, and the lamb wants to become a wolf. After years of training, the lamb becomes very evil-looking. He and the wolf return to his old barn, but the lamb can't kill the other lambs and ends up killing the wolf. However, he's no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends and can't go back to his old life. The art is beautiful, the songs are okay, and the voice acting is good. This movie is a great masterpiece, though hard to find today.
This movie is the worst I've seen. Bad acting, bad script, bad everything. Compared to Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993), also directed by Albert Pyun, it fails in story and directing. The plot is unoriginal: a dystopian world where cyborgs need human blood, and a girl with a robot must save mankind. The Hong-Kong styled fighting scenes are terrible. I only recommend this as a new "worst ever" movie. Fans should watch Cyborg or Nemesis instead. I rated it 1/10.
Pros: Nothing  Cons: Everything  Plot summary: A female reporter meets a hitchhiker who tells her stories about zombie-related deaths.  Review: The Zombie Chronicles is a horrible horror film with a $20 budget, awful actors, and gross rather than frightening gore. Avoid it like a disease.  My last 2 cents: Made by Brain Damage Films, who must truly have brain damage to produce this.  My rating: 1 out of 10 (deserves a negative bajillion)
Cool idea, but the writing, directing, editing, and acting were all botched. Makes me wish I could hit everyone involved with lightning.
Gene Kelly is miscast as Jerry Mulligan in "An American in Paris," making it hard to believe him as a penniless artist. His persona is too ambitious for the role, which requires a more carefree character. Kelly’s Jerry is often unlikable, acting poorly towards women, especially Lise, who is played by a shy and vulnerable Leslie Caron. Her performance makes Jerry seem creepy rather than charming. The film would have benefited from a younger, more playful actor as Jerry, contrasting better with the other characters and improving the ballet's impact. Despite Kelly's talents, he wasn't right for this role. The movie has positives, like the art direction, Caron’s charm, Guetary’s performance, and Foch's beauty and emotional depth. However, Jerry Mulligan remains an ill-fit.
Based on the infamous Jonestown mass suicide, this 1980 made-for-TV film is a superb recreation of Rev. Jim Jones’s life. Boothe’s performance as Jones is riveting. The film features an all-star cast, including Ned Beatty, Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, and LeVar Burton. Tastefully done but horrifying, it successfully holds attention even after twenty years.
A movie that tries to be smarter than its creators can handle. It twists through numerous plot "surprises" and includes steamy scenes to maintain interest. James Belushi and other actors seem to sleepwalk through their roles. The plot is silly and tacky, with tiresome twists towards the end. It generates some interest in the middle but is only worth watching on a very boring day. A rather lame 4!
This Barbara Stanwyck double bill includes "To Please A Lady" (1950) and "Jeopardy" (1953). The former, co-starring Clark Gable, is a typical star vehicle with predictable romance but remains watchable due to the leads. The standout feature, however, is "Jeopardy," a thriller where Stanwyck faces life-threatening peril to save her husband, with a memorable performance by Ralph Meeker. Meeker’s role, despite his limited film success, shines here. John Sturges directs, with Victor Milner’s cinematography and Dimitri Tiomkin’s score enhancing the film. This disc, part of a Stanwyck centenary box set, includes a radio version of "Jeopardy" and trailers. "Jeopardy" stands as a classic noir.
This was a film I never would have picked, but I watched it on IFC. Eric Stolz and William Forsythe caught my interest. If I had changed the channel, I would have missed a treasure. The story is about a young author paralyzed from a climbing accident in a lower-class rehab center. Written by Neal Jimenez after his own paralysis, it avoids being a manipulative tear-jerker. The patients, from different backgrounds, share a sense of helplessness. Stolz plays a "lone wolf" dependent on his girlfriend, Helen Hunt. Wesley Snipes is a former ladies' man with a broken family, and William Forsythe excels as a tough guy seeking revenge for his lost independence. See this film.
This is another Madhur Bhandarkar film showing child moles***ion and g*y concepts, which I find really disgusting. It tells the story of an entertainment reporter, played by Mrs Iyer, and includes stories of her friends, colleagues, film stars, models, and others featured in her newspaper. Mrs Iyer gives a good performance and is likely to be noticed for this role, though she is less glamorous than usual. However, the movie loses focus and it’s unclear what the director wants to convey, be it the glamor of the rich, the life of an entertainment reporter, media control by the rich and government, child abuse, or g*y issues. The film also touches on topics like sleeping with directors to enter Bollywood, flight assistants marrying older men out of frustration, and issues in rich families. It might be too complex for an average viewer seeking stress relief from daily life.
In 1972, I was introduced to the U.N.C.L.E.-verse via I.T.V.'s airing of all eight features. 'The Karate Killers' opened with an impressive action scene, cementing my fandom. The plot follows Solo and Kuryakin pursuing a formula to extract gold from seawater, divided by Dr. True and sent to his five daughters. Cameos include Telly Savalas, Terry-Thomas, and Curt Jurgens, with Kim Darby playing one of True's daughters. Despite its potential, the film suffers from being made for TV, with no real location filming and repetitive sequences. Joan Crawford is hammy, Curt Jurgens miscast, Terry-Thomas delightful, and Herbert Lom effective as the villain. Surprisingly, the film remains more entertaining than some cinema releases of that era, though the escape from THRUSH's North Pole base remains a mystery.
Think a talking parrot's not for you? Think again. Paulie is a wonderful film with touching moments and lovable characters, especially Paulie. His journey is worth experiencing. Don't miss it! Available on home video.
Nine years after its final episode, Wildside still impacts me. It surpassed other cop dramas with its realistic portrayal of the streets and life events. Unlike the over-dramatized "Underbelly," Wildside stayed true to Sydney's uniqueness with A-grade acting. Sadly, only a few actors advanced their careers while others faded. I urge the ABC to release the complete series on DVD, not just the first three.
Another wonderful Patterson book turned into an awful movie. If big-budget movies fail, why make a worse low-budget TV movie? I desperately want a good movie to do his books justice!
Lincoln's slowness represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation, making him a great leader civilizing the American frontier through law. The movie includes elements like a lurking slave and Death By Injun. The 'slow' conceit results in a brilliant, funny, and moving film. Despite historical inaccuracies, it portrays an inspiring view of history. Highlights include Henry Fonda's introductory stroll, his visit by the river, dalliance with Mary Todd on the porch, and the priceless 'Ma'am, we've got to hurry!' scene. The courtroom drama thins out, but Fonda remains priceless throughout.
'The Rookie' is a wonderful movie about second chances and fulfilling dreams, evoking deep emotions. Like 'Remember the Titans', it's a feel-good film for all ages and hits a major home run!
Devil’s Experiment, part of the Guinea Pig series, is a mid-80s Japanese "extreme" fake snuff film. Its plot is simple: a young girl undergoes brutal tortures to test her breaking point, featuring convincing effects like skin slicing, eyeball scenes, and realistic hand-breaking. Some less effective sequences involve unconvincing slap and kicking sessions. The actress convincingly portrays pain, enduring loud noises, being strung up in a net, and other abuses like being spun in a chair and forced to drink until she pukes. Despite criticisms, many effects are commendable given the low budget. Worth a watch if you’re into extreme horror. 8.5/10.
Rachel Griffiths directs this award-winning 15-minute short film about coping with grief and cherishing memories. Bud Tingwell gives a touching performance as Will, a widower who takes care of his late wife's pet cow, Tulip, facing loneliness and helplessness. With good cinematography, great direction, and superb acting, it captures deep emotions and will resonate with anyone who has lost a loved one.
Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on a literal and figurative wild ride through Mumbai high society. Stars, starlets, and business tycoons are sharply portrayed, with each colorful story serving as a clever subplot. Characters include a dumped starlet, a high-profile couple, a pedophile businessman, and various reporters and police. Bhandarkar exposes their dramas impressively. Performances from Atul Kulkarni, Boman Irani, and Sandhya Mrudul are strong, while Konkona Sen Sharma is effective but could look more polished for her role. This highly focused (140 min) and refreshingly different film is well worth the money.
Cartoon Network seems desperate for ratings. Since canceling Samurai Jack and removing popular shows like Powerpuff Girls and Dexter's Lab, they've put up mediocre shows. Total Drama Island/Action and Chowder stand out, but others are terrible remakes or rip-offs.   Johnny Test is a clear rip-off of Dexter's Lab. The main character Johnny, his twin sisters, and a rival genius are all reminiscent of Dexter's characters. The art style is awful, and the characters are annoying and repulsive. Many episodes revolve around irritating plots that lack viewer connection.  The writing ranges from mediocre to horrid, with poor and repetitive dialogue. Characters and villains seem borrowed from other sources, adding nothing original. Alongside ugly animation, the voice acting is mostly unpleasant.  Overall, Johnny Test is a bad cartoon. Its teen culture jokes alienate children, and its uninspired, dragging episodes fail to engage teens. It's an over-promoted show that tests the viewer's patience more than anything. Stick to Spongebob for a better option.
Since September, I've borrowed four to six films weekly from the Harold Washington Library, which has an impressive DVD collection. Recently, I found The Short Films of David Lynch. Yesterday, I watched Dumbland, an eight-episode animated series, and for David Lynch fans, it’s worth half an hour. The most notable feature is the soundtracks, each with its unique rhythm using respiratory and digestive sounds, outrageous voices, physical violence, birds chirping, and buzzing sockets. The pacing of the animation syncs with the sound, reflecting Lynch's primary interest. The odd, ugly, profound, dumb, and funny situations offer space to reflect on human absurdity. For fans of Inland Empire, Dumbland is worth your time.
This remarkable film, while inevitably compared to "Princess Bride," stands uniquely apart with its distinct plot, script, performances, special effects, cinematography, and score. The effective score immerses us into its fantasy world, driving the story with the right amount of awe and excitement. The film is not confusing and the interplay between the subplots makes it compelling. Well-cast and superbly acted, it's the best fantasy adventure since "Return of the King." Ignore negative reviews and poor PR; this is the best movie experience you could have this summer.
Kept my attention from start to finish. Great performances, especially by Mr. Pacino.
I doubt that's a Scott film. Remember Blade Runner and Alien? Two greats versus one. I hope to never see it. Goodbye!
A tragically wonderful movie set in a now-lost Japan, unmatched by Hollywood in atmosphere. If you enjoy serene yet intense storylines, this is a must-see, offering a break from flashy blockbusters. Kurosawa delivers one of his better stories with deep, intense characters, despite dealing with geishas and brothels without becoming explicit.
Bulletproof is a reminder of how bad bad can be. We often see "pretty awful" films, but this one is exceptionally terrible. This birthday gift from a DVD bargain bin is utterly clichéd, poorly written, directed, and acted. It's surprisingly awful, and unlike some bad films that are enjoyable, this one isn't. I stopped watching after 45 minutes and will throw it in the bin tomorrow.
This relaxed romantic-comedy is thoroughly enjoyable. Meg Ryan excels as Einstein's genius niece, while Tim Robbins shines as the mechanic who falls for her. Walter Matthau is perfect as Albert Einstein. The movie is relaxing yet serious. I found it extremely entertaining, especially the hilarious old scientists. This movie is underrated and great for those with a cheeky sense of humor.
"Shiner" is an over-the-top film with some powerful moments, but they're rare. While I appreciate Calson's attempts, atrocious editing ruins it. The acting, especially from Linda and Young Guy, is painfully bad, delivering poorly written lines without skill. The choppy editing makes their roles seem gratuitous, trying to avoid the film being just an oddball gay film. However, the performances by Nicholas T. King (Bob) and David Zelinas (Tim) stand out, capturing what Calson aimed for. Tim, a boxer with low self-esteem masked by arrogance, gets stalked by the creepy Bob, leading to the film's only emotional catharsis. Scott Stepp and Derris Nile (Tony and Danny) have moments but can't escape a cartoon-like portrayal. The raw material could tell this story better, but King's and Zelinas's performances offer something special and are worth seeing.
This movie sets a new low in Bollywood, becoming the standard for bad films. It starts with style but meanders and loses its plot. Despite good elements like a deranged don, smart Alec, femme fatale, gravity-defying hit-man, and a cop with a large team, the direction fails. It insults even the most brain-dead viewers. The only redeeming feature is the music by Vishal-Shekhar. I wish more money was spent on the visuals. Lastly, how does Akshay's bullet wound vanish instantly? Tashan, maybe.
The film made a fascinating period of history seem dull. Key figures like Wm C Quantrill, Frank James, Cole Younger, and Bloody Bill Anderson were barely or never shown. Instead, we were given undeveloped fictitious characters. However, the costumes and Missouri locations were excellent. I hope Ang Lee or another filmmaker will explore this rich historical material again.
I loved this film when it first came out in 1982. Seeing Luciano Pavarotti at the Metropolitan Opera in New York later made the film's ending even more memorable. The music is brilliant, Pavarotti was at his best, and the story has hilarious moments, like the 'food fight' scene. The hot air balloon flight over Napa Valley was gorgeous, and Pavarotti's English song "If we were in love" was beautiful, as was the duet of Santa Lucia. This film showcases Pavarotti as the opera singer Georgio Fini, with excellent support from Kathryn Harrold and Eddie Albert. I cherish my VHS tape of this movie and wish it would be released on DVD, especially for Pavarotti's performance of Nessun Dorma, one of the best captured on film.
This was just a pile of dog sh!t! How anyone can call this cool or decent is beyond me. If you like rushed editing, bad acting, and a bad script, then go for it! No suspense, the gore was laughably fake. I'll take Hostel or Wolf Creek over this any day. My partner quit after 20 minutes; I stupidly sat through the whole thing. No luck! I haven't seen Torched and doubt I will now.
If you're really bored, watch Phat Beach, but don't rent or buy it. I found myself laughing at some subtle jokes, but it wasn't very funny overall. For laughs, watch Friday; for emotional impact, watch Hoop Dreams or Jason's Lyric; for nudity, try a Dominique Simone flick. If it's on cable and you have nothing better to do, you might be slightly amused. ***3 out of 10***
The movie about Dutch Schultz, a real figure, misrepresents his life with overdramatized events and inaccuracies. It omits significant details like his public relations challenges and religious conversion. The scene depicting Schultz’s execution and his interaction with his mother paying protection to Legs Diamond are implausible. The character of his mother is unnecessary for comic relief, and the portrayal of Legs Diamond is inaccurately humorous. Schultz was a killer but not a super-agent; the brewery wipeout is unrealistic. The film might have aimed for comedy, but it misses the mark.
This movie is all flash and no soul. The actors are passionate, but the numbers feel like stand-alone music videos and lack realism, sounding studio-made. Off-stage performances are dull, especially Hudson's clichéd character, which lacks depth. Hudson's Oscar win is undeserved; her singing is emotional but misplaced due to poor writing/directing, and her acting fails to flesh out her character. Murphy's character has an arc but is not Oscar-worthy, while Glover brings depth to a minor role. The film lacks drama, heart, or humor, misplacing musical numbers and seeming to mock the genre. It’s a big, boring waste of time and the worst film of '06.
"The Order" appears promising but results in a poorly executed plot. It suffers from terrible dialogue, awful special effects, and unimpressive acting. Only Heath Ledger's performance stands out. For your own sake: DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!
Interesting for series fans, but mostly incomprehensible. The plot is confusing along with the sequel continuity. Striking effects, but the meaning is unclear. Try to see the "NC-17" workprint version for the uncut gore.
This was a complex, colorful $.50 gem. Extraordinary effects and a plot hinging on an incestuous father's desire for his daughter and a tech-enabled world's desires. If everyone's wishes were granted, society would collapse—a fate the 'Forbidden Planet's populace suffered. The Krell's tech lingers, accessed by Morpheus to keep his daughter. An ancient plot, beautifully rendered, with timeless suspense, action, and emotion. Visually modern and foundational for sci-fi. The soundtrack is a must-hear, with perfectly synced synth music. Don't miss this classic.
For a "no budget" movie, this rocks. We laughed all the way through—really funny stuff, very non-Hollywood. The actors and music were great. The cars, gags, and subtler jokes cracked us up. I've seen some actors before, maybe from commercials. It rocked! Luckily, I got a copy from a friend of one of the actors.
"Read My Lips (Sur mes lèvres)" is a clever contemporary office politics tale that turns into a crime caper. Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel shine as leads, moving from a competitive real estate office to an ex-con world. Jacques Audiard uses Devos's hearing disability to engage viewers. Characters defy expectations throughout the unpredictable story. Despite a redundant side story, it's one of my favorite films of the year! (originally written 7/28/2002)
Why did they make this movie? If Timothy Olyphant wasn't shirtless several times, there'd be no reason to watch it. Plot? Nope. Well-defined characters? Nope. The only laugh I got was from my boyfriend mocking it. P.S. Andy Dick? Nope.
This movie isn't great, but it's enjoyable. It feels like an indie film based on a play script. Morgan Freeman plays himself, despite the director's claims otherwise. There's irony in Freeman's character doing supermarket research for a film he hasn't committed to, which he ultimately makes. The dialogue is overly positive but refreshing. The film inspires viewers to reflect on their lives, though it overemphasizes appearance. Bottom line: a nice film made in two weeks with two main actors, dialogue-driven, and makes Morgan Freeman look good.
National Lampoon was once a funny magazine, but by the early eighties, its humor had died. This film is a perfect example of that decline. Beyond a nicely illustrated title sequence, there's nothing to recommend. The opening segment, 'Growing Myself', is baffling and things do not improve. A brutal rape scene involving a stick of butter is particularly offensive, showcasing the movie's poor taste. Overall, this incoherent mess is full of crummy ideas and dire performances.
Not a big film. Acting isn't amazing, some characters are played badly. Not visually beautiful or innovative. If you like big films, avoid this. However, it excels in storytelling. Larry's relatable story resonates with our own life regrets. It’s great because it’s small and real, touching on life’s universal downsides. First watched at 15, still reflecting on it 16 years later. Always brings a smile. Watch it; it will make you happier with what you have.
"Shakedown" has Erika Eleniak, but she plays second fiddle to Wolf Larson. She has more action capabilities than shown here. The film features monotonous shootouts with bad guys constantly missing Larson, who easily takes them out with a revolver that never runs out of bullets. Earthquake effects are decent but marred by blurry motion and poor CGI explosions. Ron Perlman, as a psychotic "spiritual leader," struggles with boring pseudo-religious dialogue. Eleniak, Perlman, or Larson completists might be interested, but for others, it's barely worth a rental. (*1/2)
I first saw this film on a flight from Paris to Newark in August 1996. The film is a masterpiece, depicting a divorced father and businessman, played by the sexy Daniel Auteuil, who finds new zest for life through a friendship with a Down Syndrome man. This believable relationship changes Daniel's life and teaches that life is about living and loving, not just work. Despite a silly ending, it remains one of my favorite movies, enough to bring a tear to your eye.
Brilliant adaptation of the monologues of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus, and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick, recreating Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday. Bravo to Strick, screenwriter Haines, casting director, and cinematographer for this masterpiece. I favorably compare it to Volker Schlöndorff's The Tin Drum (1979). Recognizable Dublin landmarks and characters are in the novel and film, such as Buck Mulligan being a prominent surgeon. This excellent film is enhanced by multiple viewings.

This "pre Sci-Fi" movie featuring Lugosi and Karloff is incredible, showcasing the actors at their best along with a compelling story. Karloff excels as a scientist torn by vanity, pride, and competition, making the descent both saddening and fascinating. A remake with Harrison Ford and Kiefer Sutherland could come close, but the original stands as one of Hollywood's best.
I'm someone who loves tech history, so I should be this film's target audience. Yet, I found it amateurish and slow. The 1997-era graphics are outdated and distract from the story. Watching it via German satellite TV, I couldn't help but laugh at the poor design note for "Gottdog." Ada Lovelace deserves a straightforward biographical film, not a sci-fi twist. The idea of recreating lost history with intelligent agents is absurd, and the notion that a computer can predict everything is debunked by modern science. The mouse-click "programming" is laughable. Some technical consultation could have helped. It's a unique film like "Pi," but too flawed to enjoy. 3/10.
I saw this movie yesterday and couldn’t stop watching, even though I guessed the plot. Farrell and the cast were great. Some parts stretched believability, but I loved it! If you can, watch it! I cried at a few scenes, especially as a mom. Loretta is beautiful, and the idea of unwed moms seemed ahead of its time. WATCH IT and ignore criticisms. I laughed, I cried! Thoroughly enjoyed it!
This quirky British movie excels with low budget and cameo roles despite a weak story. Judi Dench, a widowed woman, reunites the "blonde bombshells," a wartime girl band. The film humorously showcases older folks' feelings and zest. Dench is superb; more focus on other bombshells would've been nice. Ian Holm is adequate as the transvestite drummer, but David Jason might've been better. A cheery movie, perfect for a night in with friends.
Takashi Miike's foray into kiddie films captivated me quickly with his bold handling of dark fantasy elements. This fairy tale embraces its sinister side, reflecting the true nature of classic tales. Miike wisely elevates the archetypical kid's quest into a serious adventure filled with real fears, unlike most Western adaptations. His honesty and unique approach make this film exceptional. Highly recommended.
Wonderful and exciting tale of romance and intrigue with memorable music. Very colorful movie. Also enjoyed High Society with Bing Crosby. Wonderful music. Thanks, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
Drum scene is wild! Cook, Jr. is the unsung hero. Fantastic actor, great flick with twists. A must-see.
This movie was horrible. The casting was off; Katelyn looked nothing like her TV mom. The plot was cliché, predictable, and the ending was disappointing and cheesy. Katelyn's fake crying scene was terrible, and her acting was unimpressive, resembling Hillary Duff on Lizzie Maguire. Overall, it was a mix of every cliché kid movie from the 90s, only worse. I give it an 'F' because it was hard to sit through. However, kids 9 or under might like it.
The musical numbers are spectacular, but the story is tiresome and repetitive with loud, unhappy show producers. Cagney's constant shouting becomes headache-inducing. The songs are not memorable compared to "42nd Street." Overall, I was very disappointed with this early Cagney and Berkeley film.
My favorite horror film. From the first shot to the final twist, Carpenter's masterpiece.<br /><br />Halloween 1963, Michael Meyers murders his sister. Halloween 1978, Michael escapes and returns to kill.<br /><br />The story is simple: Michael stalks and kills babysitters. Carpenter's atmosphere of dread creates tension. Events seem random, keeping the audience uneasy.<br /><br />Dark lighting, steady-cam shots, and eerie music create claustrophobic scenes. The body count is small and murders are nearly bloodless—the fear is in the unknown.<br /><br />The acting is good. PJ Soles provides humor, Nancy Loomis delivers a decent performance, and Jamie Leigh-Curtis is perfect for her character. Donald Pleasence is perfectly cast as Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace, Mr. Pleasence.<br /><br />The film's flaw is the passage of time and many imitators diluting its power. To appreciate it, view it as a unique piece.<br /><br />Highly recommend for a good scare. Highest regards.<br /><br />10/10
I saw this film ten years ago and found it very funny, despite some critics' opinions. Written by John Hughes, it has expectably funny dialogue. The movie's unique look with primary colors and a strong cast, especially Bunny Packard and Delores Salk, stands out. Though dated, I prefer it over other 'Lampoon' series.
This film is great. It is realistic and sometimes brutal, but I don't find it depressing or negativistic. Despite heavy scenes and bad characters, it also shows love, beauty, and humor. Unlike other films, Seidl doesn't depict working-class lives as trash. Some viewers may fear admitting that no one's life is completely 'clean' and 'normal.' The most beautiful scene is the old man watching his old girl dance. Those who find it ugly lack a sense of beauty.
David Lynch's The Straight Story diverges from his usual style, portraying Alvin Straight's real-life 300-mile lawn mower journey to reconcile with his sick brother. Richard Farnsworth's heartfelt performance anchors the film, mirroring Alvin's slow, reflective journey. Along the way, Alvin encounters diverse characters, offering insights and helping them reconsider their paths, from a pregnant runaway to bickering brothers. The film's simple, honest scenes, including Alvin's connection with a kind man who fixes his mower, deepen our investment in Alvin's quest for forgiveness. Farnsworth's final performance is poignant and impactful, leaving a lasting impression.
I can't say Aag is the worst Bollywood film ever since I haven't seen them all, but it could be. This film seems like the director's artistic suicide, and he’s succeeded. No A-list actor outside this film would risk the humiliation associated with it. The blame extends to the cinematographer, who seems like an amateur, the over dramatic score, the poor lighting, and the actors, who are not newcomers, making it harder to forgive. These A-list actors willingly joined this remake of 'Sholay,' a beloved classic. Did they believe their performances could match the original? Did Amitabh Bachchan think people would remember his dialogue in this farce? Of course not. This film is a vulgar attempt to remake a classic, only polluting everyone's mind when they watch the original.
This Stephen King-derived fast-paced fright-flick is too bright and modern, lacking the dark, mysterious atmosphere the plot—about a teenage boy who is a "Sleepwalker"—needs. Alice Kridge shines as the boy's mother, offering a creepy and intense performance. However, the film's colorful look and uneven tone, swinging between thriller, comedy, and drama, undermine its potential. Cameos include Stephen King, John Landis, and Tobe Hooper. *1/2 from ****
I had to fast forward through this poorly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes as nothing was happening. Has anyone mentioned the opening scene—a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and impaled on the grass in the front yard! I guess the bratty kid did it, but it's never explained. I wish this film had been better written or thought out because it makes no sense. I would like to see a cleaner version and any missing footage to see if it would help. Otherwise, it's an odd film best fast-forwarded through!
Everyone regrets things. For some, it's signing a note for a new Hummer; for me, it was watching "D-War: Dragon Wars." From the repetitive title, I should've known. Fifteen minutes in, after the old man's backstory explanation, I realized how predictable and terrible the plot would be. The film lacks sufficient nuance to describe its badness, with extra sub-plots sprouting whenever meaningful dialogue threatened. It’s full of close calls, miraculous escapes, and poorly explained angst.  Imagine combining set pieces from successful action movies: rasta-talking amphibians from Star Wars, Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise lookalikes with film noir narration, a Lord of the Rings-style villain, and angry giant cobras. Mash it all together in modern Los Angeles, and you get a homogenized mess. Several times, I pleaded, "Make the bad movie stop," and cried.   Calling this a B-movie is generous. With effort, it might be a C-level film. If you ever want to waste money and brain cells for self-punishment, "Dragon Wars" is for you.
Question: In light of bad reviews - or car crashes - I feel compelled to make a transmission and give merit where due. Many people might automatically say it was bad, but here's my take:  It's rare for a movie to have suspense throughout, but this one did, despite its flaws. The life-threatening situation lasts the whole movie, and the tension never lets up. It's an all-action movie that stays on the road and never becomes talky, similar to Duel or Speed. The constant tension is its best feature.  The acting is not bad, with The Judge being particularly good. The script is good though sometimes a bit awry, but unrealistic elements aren't necessarily a fault. The lead actor's involvement seems justified.  The stunts are mostly terrific, especially for a TV movie, although the speed might sometimes appear slow. I liked that it said "inspired by a true story" at the beginning, implying the basis of the story is true without making you question how much.  A reviewer suggested using a tow truck to lift the back wheels up, which is a good idea. It's odd no car expert was consulted in the movie.  I hope this review reverses the idea that this film is a disaster and helps it become a success. The pic quality is a bit soft for a DVD.  SPOILER: They would have been winched out after the baby, but that idea was cleverly faded out in conversation. End of movie, suspension of disbelief is challenged with the baby rescue scene.
Director Ron Howard's 1986 comedy "Gung Ho" stars Michael Keaton as Hunt Stevenson, a union rep from a struggling Pennsylvania town trying to attract Japan's Assan Motor Company to save the local plant. The film humorously explores cultural clashes between American and Japanese workers, with Keaton's character balancing the rival cultures. The cast includes Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, John Turturro, and Mimi Rogers, with standout performances, especially by Keaton and Watanabe. While "Gung Ho" feels dated, it remains a relevant social commentary. The DVD offers good digital transfer but lacks extras. *** out of 4.
The tweedy professor-types believed Polynesians descended from Asians who migrated eastward over thousands of years. However, Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl questioned this, noting that some Polynesians resemble South Americans and share their traditions. He highlighted similarities in vegetation and legends pointing to South America as their ancestral home. Heyerdahl's theory was bolstered by Scandinavian tales of ancestors fleeing from South America. Determined to test his theory, he and his crew built a traditional raft to demonstrate that such a journey was possible. The Oscar-winning documentary, though dated and ethnocentric, captures this adventurous spirit. Highly recommended to read the amazing book first.
I'm confused. As a Seagal fan for 25 years, I've seen all his films, many dozens of times. This film is "bizarre." Seagal shares writing and producing credits, but it's hard to believe he'd choose to dub his own voice with a thin, whiny imposter's. If some lines needed dubbing, why does his real voice appear in the rest? Aging is expected, but in this movie, he lacks his usual swagger, confidence, bravado, charm, and sex-appeal. His cocky attitude and bad-ass sneer, shifting into an adorable grin, are missing. If this is what Seagal now offers, lifelong fans must concede that the Seagal we knew is gone.
