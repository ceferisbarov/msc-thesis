I don't even know where to begin on this one. "It's all about the family." That has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a "horror" movie, although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried!!! Ugh!!! And I know that Owen Wilson is a better actor. He needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man did co-write "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore." He does have some talent. Also, Lily Taylor should stick to indie films. She has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There's no room in legitimate acting for her. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, EVER.

I can't remember many details about the show, but i remember how passionate i was about it and how i was determined not to miss any episodes. Unfortunately at the time we had no VCR, so i haven't ever seen the series again. However i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor these days (i think i was almost in love) and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day, mostly due to his appearance in the series. I would gladly buy/steal/download this series, i think i would go to great lengths in order to see it again and revisit a childhood long gone... Any ideas? Does anybody knows of a site devoted to the series or has the episodes on tape from their first airing?

One is about Hitler's personality, the second deals with the forgery of the Hitler-diaries. In 1983 this forgery caused a hilarious scandal in England and Germany, damaging the reputations of several historians and journalists.

As a former sub, this was the worstmarine. First, ainyard any US vessel, alearedidentmarine in. These men are the best best and are to their mission. The responsibility is and they take seriously the way from the Captain the junior crew. I could never see a crew of any ship split their alliance between the and the Officer. An Officer who acted as the Character by Washington did would be of duties andled, thenmed Navy. It is no surprise the Navy to send a technical to help in this., if any of a crew made the of noise made underway on this vessel beelyed. Submariners learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They don't slam doors and even speak quietly and wear soft soled shoes when underway. I was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew while underway. Loud music would never be tolerated. I know portraying submarine life in reality would not sell movie tickets, but this is over the top to the point of being ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
`Europa' (or, as it is also known, `Zentropa') is one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. The blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless... a true feast for the eyes. The picture was a contender for a 1991's Golden Palm in Canners. The award went to Barton Fink (by Coen brothers); a film stylistically very similar to Zentropa. Here's an exercise in class: rent both films and be a judge for yourself.
Not a very good movie but to the info its pretty accurate iningure techniques. The purpose of the film was to show theality of the NK POWps and thats done effectively enough, with surprisingness for the time. Whatever technicalws exist (and are plenty) by watching this you'll see a forgotten of a forgotten war and some prettyy stuff - again, nasty because its being done north theZ and not inamo Bay.<br /> />It think any of the Koreanans brought up hisure when running for office, and if you watch theies like this one and P Hill in comparison to the Vietnam films. It know if it was the people in '54 being trapped in the WWII concepts (the boys to wisrack a lot) or the war or what, but it's interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later would be making movies like "Go Tell The Spartans".

For, Sallylands sex-vedzy woman is really and even if you like thing doll to that theension sags badly during. Savages dken brute of anurance is equallyful but leasts a small. Of the leading actors, Nicholas Walker inspires no sympathy at all for Paul Keller's plight and his acting is wooden. Dara Tomanovich is better and during her scenes with Sheedy the level rises a little. Sheedy's meticulous, understated performance (though she often seems to be on automatic pilot) is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest. The sets are drab, the camera-work undistinguished.
Its a ghost story. Its a canal a revenge. a very poorly done film with a of violence. I suppose it follows cheaply along the of everyer movieve seen. It has the usual isolated, the coy camp, heading off to theness. Granted, there are some prettyse scenes. Its just so dull. Bad editing and the whole. There are ghost children who like they are talking into aasket. I'm not sure what rules the ghosts and thecho with the seed cap are playing by. It also has the gross out scene where a manats a of meat which is actually what of his wife. A friend mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this ofous, sick violence. I fear that it's just another step in our desensitized evolution. Three is no cleverness here, no tongue in cheek, only a sad waste of time. Lots of blood; little plot.
This is definitely the worst movie Adam's ever done but at this point in his life, he was just happy to have a movie. There are 3 or 4 laughs in it but I used the fast forward button through some of it. Don't waste your time. I only saw it because I wanted to see all of his movies, but it sucked.
Being a Film studiesate I would to think that I have seen a of films, some good some bad, but I would that 'mer' is far the ever seen! I chose the film in the hope it was be a great British classic as 'rets 'Lockstock' but oh no this was so bad that my flat I upughing anding theous acting andy script (rem of a bad 'theatre in' school production). The main characterselle and Gary began toy us the start. '' the main character who lives her two friends has the of that you would never get ofpping and Gary was so wet (he kept breaking down in tears every5 minutes) that film I really didn't give a damn about either of them. All I could think was ' I paid £3 for this pile'. I have never written a review before but after watching this film it has spurred me on to warn people of this disastrous production. So please avoid at all costs. Thanks for reading.
With Adamler.<br /><br />This is without doubt of the most idotic films ever made. Its about cruise ship waiter Shecky (Sler) wanting to be a comian on theise ship. First off, there is not oneny or clever line in the entire movie honestly. It is so unny its pathetic. There is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor, but the f-word is pliful. The budget is really low, and that alsoins the film. It takes place on aise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 shiptras, one of which is Billy Bobon. The openingits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply, and it is just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too.<br /><br />86 mins. rated R for Language.
The fight scenes play like slow-motion Jackie Chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic (worst pun by far: "Guess what? This time I heard you coming"). The stars are a mismatched pair: Brandon Lee, despite the terrible lines he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm - things that Dolph Lundgren is completely free of (at least in this movie). Note to the director: in the future, please stay away from any love scenes, especially when your main actress won't do any nudity and you have to rely extensively on a body double. (*1/2)
Do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the Baby Boomer generation? Technically, I am a Boomer, though at the time when all the "idealistic youths" of the '60s were reading Marx, burning their draft cards, and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in grade school. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools, who would believe anything as long as it was destructive.<br /><br />This is just another excercise in self-importance from the kids who never really grew up.
Although the movie is clearly,ces still easily the ofess Buster in thiseless andnydog tale.usterights against unkindlys in three different ages: the, The Roman Age and the Mod Age, playing almost same character with just a change ofery to help us identify the different "ages". In this movie we see of the earliestedic of the "c", who wins his love not by romance byute force, as as any on Romanadi combat, two comedices thatdate such as' World Part I". The underlying of is simple yet: Although the times may have-a, we still sameles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times in order to "win the girl" (keep in mind this is the theme of 1923 America, a time when chauvinism was still en vogue). It is interesting to look at this movie over eighty years later, and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie's "modern times" to now.

Then to make the movie worse, throw in a dry British relationship between the two semi-competent professors hired to assist him. Between their loving sessions, they make a couple of half-hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of London. All of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine, which would never have happened if Lembach hadn't left. This movie tried so I give it an honest 2 stars for effort, but it would have been better if they hadn't broke the damn machine, making Lembach leave, making him try it again. Damn you Lembach!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good times with the Quz Brothers, and the entire cast on this project as the "Guy thech."

Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only average, and at times down-right poor (especially at the climax of the film). Walter Pigeon, though quite excellent in other films, over-acts his role as well. Ms Francis, Earl Holliman, and the amazing Robby the Robot are the stand-out actors in this crowd, though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job. The problems with the featured performances, I think, are as much the fault of the director and the editor, as anything. Though they certainly got most of the film quite right.
I want so to give this piece of G a zero, unfortunately, theret so, I it a1 to warn you about how stupidly this imposter of a familiaroon is! The characters look like byers, no,, I' seeners better!

While I watched this I to out why theyed making it. Though the main plot is potentially, are of unrelatedunaryplots. Theing people in Hollywood haveated the multiple bad guys,ualcrosses and the man woman who get close and have sex. Its odd that we see more of them than we the President and hisress. The many plotsplots the film too and of the characters are developed - I reallyt feel like knew any character, except that everyone isrupt and. The is totally incomplete - it left me more than just wanting what have been, but what was to be. In, there is no explanation of why anyone does do, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit across. I'm surprised that so many established (and good) actors agreed to make such a hollow movie. This seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project.<br /><br />Don't waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie.
This film wasively the worst ever. It through thing. I also think writer have some weirdish for womeneing pu andpping... mean what was that about! I believe this was made and amusted at have #ingwasted a £4 fee. The quality both sound are terrible, the acting... well exist . It was a poor film and the scenes of pee,ke were of 2.ghh.......IDOST! The girls they had been picked and only got part theyd to take their off... While these girls have nice bodies it certainly the fact their shking was awful un and a to my ears.<br /><br />This was like (possibly worse) than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car?! <br /><br />Definatey not one to buy folks. Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but I could not find anything positive to say and I would like to think I may save someone else wasting their money like I have.
Perfecties are rare. Even my favorite films to havews - R Window looks a littley, Chris Elliots character in Gr Dayt work, the music score in Best Yearsives is too chey, the of Nightsria is a little too slow but this film is perfectly executed from finish. <br /> />The script is brilliant, the acting isb all around (although Reon and Samston areing, the castines), theing and theography are inspired, the music score ising beingive (like some Mirax scores that are too). Every sad moment is truly, every light moment makes me smile. This is of the best films I seen and I wish there more films like it.br /><br />I am glad that Reese Witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film, but I am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people, real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! A must-see.

I saw the movie last night here at home, but I thought it was too long first of all. Second, the things I saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what I thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before. The things isn't funny in the movie: fiancé hitting his girlfriend, beatings. The movie was way too long--talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing! Some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture--like the lady singing--i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here! come on Perry, you can do better then this!

i think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had. only £300,000 and 7 weeks to write, film and edit the whole thing which i think is an achievement in itself. although this film is not for the masses (as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homo-eroticism involved in the story) i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story, the more sadness you feel. more so towards Heaton because of the love he feels but is not returned.<br /><br />this is one of my favourite British films that i enjoyed very much and would watch again. i think that it's a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all.

After eagerly waiting to the end, I have to say I wish I wouldnt have joined the whole series at the first place. The final episode was everything against the previous seven years. It hasined everything. The journey was 23 years, but captainay has the power to reduce it... let say, seven years only. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the wholeure? Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey. Why she wants to save Seven ofine only? The otherst count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them. As the say, "journey is more important than the destination". Unievable. And at the finale scene the are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, returning to the normal life.<br />br />Worst ending ever.
there should be a sub-genre in the Western called 'the Robert Mitchum Western'. Mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic, usually undervalued Westerns import his film noir persona to etch some compellingly dark character sketches, and bring an elegiac world-weariness more familiar from the films of Sam Peckinpah. 'Man with the gun' is one of his best. Directed by Orson Welles protege Richard Wilson, it is a stark, monochrome beauty, full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence, as Mitchum comes to tame a town terrorised by a monopolist with a private army. Mitchum's regression from soft-spoken stranger to deranged murderer, with a host of dark emotions in between, is a marvel of expressive, physical acting.
OK. Who brought the cheese. I love it. During it's run it became a phenomenon. The Anorexic Twins became popular.Bob Saget started making a paycheck (Instead of his REALLY funny stand-up). And people knew who Dave Coulier was. This is when life was good and simple. This is one of the great American classics. It was humorous and always brought home a good lesson. And this is where I differ from the norm: I liked the last few seasons. Like Home Improvement, when children get older there are a lot more you can do with the script. This is why I dare say...It could have gone much later than it did. But anyway. I gave it an 8/10 because of its wholesome, funny story lines, and because of Bob Saget!

I am Black American and I loved this soap opera. I watched itbed in Spanish onundo, almost 5-7 years ago. The story was a TRUE story about a black slave whos love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid, whimsical way of living.<br /> />A lot of us could learn a lot from XICA. She took what she had, nothing, and saw her possibilities. Many would argue that she sold herself out - but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children /> />It was such an excellent soap opera, that I thought it would be released on DVD, but its not being released. This soap opera was the best soap opera EVER. We need for it to be released on DVD or broadcast on TV again. Its playing onca America right now, which is only available in Mexico or in the US by paid cable. We need it released again to Telemundo.

This is one of the most god-awful movies ever. Shaq better just stick to basketball. This movie took away apart of my life I will never have back. I will make fun of this movie until I die, and then some. It is so horrible it is not even funny. MST3000 would have a blast with this one.

I confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of The Duke's more popular outings.<br /><br />Recommended.
Harem Suare is the best film I saw in the year 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Sensually shot and stunningly portrayed, Harem Suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance, which is such a taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes, and color, populate the film. Cut off from the outside world, the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue, rivalry and jealousies within their ranks.
For a film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about, this was pretty good. Its another one of these modernday British crime films that are quky ("Satch," "Sast," etc.). Its not wild like "Satch" but its interesting and it has some rough characters.<br /> />It also has a corny and somewhatable ending but early the show - not late - has some neatists to make it very interesting for the firsttimewer. Basically, its about a low-key British male who sends away for a Russian "mail orderride" who up, with the of two Russian male friends, providing a couple of bigises />Ben Chapin and Nicoleman-star, and are very good as are Vincentel and Matthieu Kitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is a different kind of film and well-acted. Kidman once again proves she's far more than just a beautiful face.
A far as B-ies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad, that it becomes incrediblyying to sit through. A lonelyer high school student who is constantly picked on by classates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redck. He then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield andills him. Apparently, the kids soul was transfered into arow which then goes around killing thelies whomented him as well as teachers. Thisarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do Matrix-like fps through the air and kill people on sideks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rottedpse? Just like the two needless sequels that followed this, this isn't even worth a laugh.

Roy Rogers and company try to bring "Sintown" back to life - its a ghost town which may go boom if silver mining is successful. Andyine (as "Cookie") ssticks around. Jane Frae (as Carol)es a of her bitches to Mr.ers' sharp leer. Foy Willing and the Riders theage stand-in (or, is that singin?) for the A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and theers. James Finon (from thely films) adds to the "slapstick" look of "Grandon Trail". A loose floor board delivers the winning comedy performance. Mr.ines mule kicks itsels.

After losing his cattle herd to a dishonest lawman, a trail boss winds up in the Yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states. While there his fortunes take a turn for the best until a bad luck specter from the past comes calling. Good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup.

Even though this was a disaster in the box office, It is my favorite film. It gives a powerful message of family. It has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis. Compared to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. It is an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian Godfather, Amitabh portrays that in this film. Don't read reviews by critic, they're just ignorant. This movie has good mix of comedy, romance, drama, and especially action. So if you want to see action more realistic than Main Hoon Na(still good movie), this is the movie.
I am definitely a Burt Reynolds fan, but sorry, this one really stinks. Most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie. I can't believe he even made this one. Is he actually that hard up for money?
Are you kidding that was AWFUL!!! <br /><br />But that notwithstanding I got given this film and 3 others and they were all on DVD. The film starts of pretty much an OK movie but goes downhill from about the middle onwards.<br /><br />And the ending well let's just say it was one of the most anti climatic endings in recent film history. Lots of gore in the end sequence and if you like a dose of schlock horror then this is the film for you....<br /><br />3/10

(Question) What you call 100 film critics buried sand? A start., I dont know Peter Mattei from Adam but if he is thedingur his filmography suggests, "Love in of M" is a " start". Ay shoot with whimsical music box style music, this flick looks at a of tenuous relationships as it moves from person to B C...etc...and back again ending with A B in carousel fashion. The film gentlyes the unhappy circumstances of nine people with finely rendered shings beginning and ending with a street whore and her client. The downside of this film is the of a story which may have with the many criticalams it received. I watched theoth "Angels in" last night and was bored at the end while this little concatenation of character studies kept me spell bound. Use caution. I may be the only person who really liked this flick. (B)
I expected a comedy like the "Big M"ies., the movie was a bre of comedy drama and a story.<br /> />This movie has three plots: first involvesa her taking in a child second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is abusing her involves a between a single mother with 2 and a single father />There is actually little in movie. are also a of veryisted messages the movie.,aats the child at (in a comedic manner), toince the child toen out. The child does,, turn around.ently, it to beat children />There are plots with childpe (with the the mother). There are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them. (The ogling takes place at a family reunion.) The movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always off-balance. Is this a comedy, a love story, or a drama? It is, in fact, nothing ... except a waste of time and money.
This astonishing of production money is filmic that the rich and famous can as stupid and asicians.

The result is sourd and that it almosties belief.ually the isular but that is the of nature that has allowed the setting and the that a real home is used a set. Theill of a scing Taylor,tons halfleep wings, the loony dialog,ard laughing at himself, theous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer. BOOM is a disgrace, a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet's plebs. Not even fun. Just terrible and mad shocking waste.
I have been a fan of Pushing Daisies since the very beginning. It is wonderfully thought up, and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show.<br /><br />It is unbelievable on how much TV has been needing a creative, original show like Pushing Daisies. It is a huge relief to see a show, that is unlike the rest, where as, if you compared it to some of the newer shows, such as Scrubs and House, you would see the similarities, and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in identity.<br /><br />With a magnificent cast, wonderful script, and hilarity in every episode, Pushing Daisies is, by-far, one of the most remarkable shows on your television.
Peeew this! As knowss based upon some Geicoals; what one isY! Thoseals wereusing oning best; hardly f a. (The talkingcko --s another story. that make aning series!) And why earth did ABC -- as reported the -- actually to the cavemen character rights from for this?, the ofemen struggling in hardly unique to TV;man aing Live as Theyer. And thats how a concept this works best as anionalment. But a?it. (A9s series "'s About Time" also used the cavemen in the modern world concept. It lasted one season.) <br /><br />One of the show's directors, who was also responsible for the Geico commercials, was recently quoted as saying: "We were so excited when we were shooting our commercials because we felt like we had something that was very unique and we had bigger stories to tell." Wrong.<br /><br />In the annals of bad TV, this is destined to take its place alongside 1972's "Me and the Chimp" as one of the all-time worst. The lead actor in the embarrassing Chimp fiasco actually went into shame-by-association hiding after it was abruptly canceled. No doubt our cavemen friends will follow suit.
Born Again is a okay episode of Season 1. The rearnation bit, in my opinion, is cool. The more I watch it, the more I like it, yet it will never rise above 'Very Good' for me.

One leaves thinking not so much about how cool it is when Karas is evading bullets shot through a crowded glass Parisian street, but more about its ponderance of life and death, how life's tragedies, such as death, make life meaningful.
This is one strange hacked together film, you get the feeling that the bond company had to come in on this one, I'm not surprised there's no credits on it, who would want to be associated with this film. The Acting of all involved is terribly stilted and the plot jumps around all over, it all makes very little sense. As I said before it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems like there was alot of footage that wasn't shot that needed to be, and all the music was very ill-fitting library music (cheap I guess). Very, very odd. I might actually buy a DVD of it though, if it could let me in on what the hell was going on, and what happened to this movie.

FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF films. Its influence was felt for more than a decade. However, certain elements relating to how this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at a mid-fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit, and the film's sometimes sluggish pacing doesn't help. But, the story's compelling central idea involving the ancient,extinct Krell civilization and "monsters from the Id" hasn't lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant "must see" movie. What I'm mostly interested in saying here is that the current DVD for this movie is terrible. The movie has never really looked that good on home video and it's elements are in dire need of restoration. I hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this SF classic.

What starts astable andmill up dark and character-centered. The entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable. Mitchum is his usual excellent self here in Man With The Gun - not one of his very best performances, Mitchum still has his classic and effective tough-guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action-packed, meaningful, and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park. Man With The Gun is a nice Mitchum western and is easily worth one's time.

When someone puts out something that was popular to a fan base, and expects the fans to shell out money to watch, and then delivers something than wasn't even close to what the fans expect - well, I am sorry, that is just plain WRONG! OK, so if they were making a kids' movie - fine - next time distribute it straight to video, where many of these belong. But don't package something up in a familiar wrapper and change the innards.
It is not un-common to see U.S. re-makes of foreign movies that fall flat on their face, but here is the flip side!!! This is an awful re-make of the U.S. movie "Wide Awake" by the British!<br /><br />"Wide Awake" is strange but entertaining and funny! "Liam" on the other hand is just strange. I must give credit to "Liam" for one thing, and that is making it clear that I made the right choice in changing my religion!
I saw this film at the NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and thought it was pretty bad. First and most distracting was the way much of it was shot; that is, a lot of slow motion and overly arty close-ups that seemed to have no point--story wise or aesthetically--other than to show the skills of the cinematographer (who I believe was also the director). This film seemed what a pretentious film student would come up with. The lead actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very cute, but was a mediocre actor at best; and the rest of the cast ranged from so-so, to bad. The story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable. I do have to concede that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the film; laughing and sighing constantly, but I disliked it a great deal.
Well what can I say, there are B-Gradeies and there are-radeies and this definitely falls into the latter. However since its obvious that even theers of the film know that its not aible movie (take a at the closingits) it can beiven.<br />br />The plot is basically a convictedychoiller is killed. He accidentally has his genetic material mixed up with some experimental acid that get combined and then lost in the snow. Theiller now takes on the form of a snowman - if you can believe that. Theman, Jackrost, is after the country town Sherif who put him behind bars. In doing so, Jackrost ends up killing half the town />This movie lacks any real scares and the effects alone remind me of the B-radeies of the 50's. This alone makes it worth watching for a laugh. A movie to pass the time away.

Where to start? This is probably the worsties I have ever seen. The editing is the worst ever, the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked. Most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects, with muddled talking in the background. I had to turn my volume on fullast just to her what was on....and what was I to hear exactly? Probably one the worst scripts ever made. I cant believe people actually put up some green for this film. It makes me think I could take arap in a box, send it tocers, and then have them finance a movie for me.<br /> />Dolph, was a usual,ph. Nothing else said. The villains were bad, the protagonists were bad, and the movie was a stinker. If you really want to know what NOT to do when either writing, directing or editing a movie, watch this!

A bar like Chucky Babys from an office window or beating up a barfly who likes his beret are welcome morsels of camp in a film that for 99% of it's running time offers a whole lot of nuttin'. Richard C. Sarafian's slightly longer original cut that played in Japan offers an additional six minutes but cries out to be cut down to a more manageable 17 minutes: the director of Vanishing Point must have thanked his lucky stars when the re-edit gave him an excuse to take his name off the film. A film so bad it's not good, and painfully unfunny with it

I also some theers haven't recognised it, when they use phrases like: "Who is Heaton? What's he doing with a retard like Spike?" This person, however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark. Spike shows noticeable signs of having A.D.D, although I don't think this person has realised this, as he seems to be using the word "retard" as a derogatory term.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film. Although it is not for the faint hearted. The film is exceedingly character based, after the shooting until the end there isn't much but dialogue between the two anti-heroes. Unless you are used to watching such deep, gritty films, stay well away.
I have seen most, if not all of the Laurel & Hardy classic films. I have always enjoyed there comical stupidly, even after watching it over and over again. This new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both Laurel & Hardy, however fails miserably for various reasons. One of which is how out of place their cloths are (still early 20th century) however are both portrayed in the 90's setting. Some of the former dialogue was brought back, however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series. This film could very well be the worst film I have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever. The real Laurel & Hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation.
I really enjoyed this movie. The acting by the adult actors was great, although I did find the main kid a little stiff. But he carried himself very well for being a new talent. The humor is very sublime and not in your face like most Hollywood comedy junk. I.e. The Nutty Professor. If you have a short attention span and are used to the typical Hollywood stuff you probably wouldn't like this as it is a bit slower paced. I picked it up on Blu-ray and I have to say the image quality is top notch. Probably one of the better looking Blu-rays I've seen so far. The extras were cool too. They deleted quite a bit, but that's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes didn't really add anything.
If you want to watch something that is for 'him' and 'her' so to say then this is the film to pick. I am a for rom coms but my husband is not always so keen (what ay!!!). Anyway I to to watch it because I him it was about sport, and what, he it!!!<br /> />Drewmore is veryny and her leading man (orry but remember name) is equally as good. When I watched the film it was called 'Thefect Match' but I think the title was changed for the UK as it is based on the book Fitch and there was film made about football with that title (the same film but the UK version - phew!), />way all of the reviews on here will you more details you need them buy girls, take it from me, get your hubby/boyfriend in front of the television on a Saturday night and you will both laugh and cry together. A real gem.
This is Not a Love Song.<br /><br />My one word summary of this film be `Excellent'. /> />It probably wont appeal to the mass movie watching public  its a< /> />film that forces you toate. You observe, think, and question /> />Comparisons could be made with Delance (Topic/Theme) and /> />haps with The W Project for overall filming style />However this film stands unique against both /> />Theography effects (solarisation, freeze frame, blur etc) />have been seen before but they are used most effectively in this />film to underpin the natural tension of the story />Acting is raw,acing and utterly believable.<br /><br />The real theme of the film is about friendship; the title really gives<br /><br />the game away. It's probably not the kind of friendship that most of<br /><br />us have experienced or indeed would want to.<br /><br />It is a love song.
The movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between.But the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable. <br /><br />But Krista Allen really rocked in the movie .Her voice was so seducing and sexy.The scenes in the bed involving Krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do.Krista really is one of the best in such roles.She also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minutes,which is the interesting part of the movie.<br /><br />Burt Reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star.He could have chosen a better script than this.Ireally think he did for money.
This Worldwide was the cheap mans version of what the NWA under Jim Croett Junior and Jimettions made back in the 190s on the localized "Big " Stations during the Saturdayning/ternoon Wrestlingze. When Ted Turner got his onetts failed version ofWA he turned it into World Wrestling and to drop allWA references all together. NWA Worldide andWA Pro Wrestling were relabeled with theW logo and moved off the road to Disney/MGM Studios inlando, Florida and eventually became nothing more than recap shows forWs Nro,under, and Saturday Night. Worldwide was officially the lastW program under Turner to air the weekend of the WW buyout fromince Mcon and WWF. Today the entireWA World Wide/WCW Worldwide Video Tape Archive along with the entire NWA/WCW Video Tape Library in general lay in the vaults of WWE Headquarters in Stamford,Connecticut.
I saw this recently and I, was moved the factual the., "H" a movie not quite work. I am, to watching theary which thecers who this project had made because I think that be a much moreelling work than this film.<br />The international cast was of B- actors but their was appropriate, and I must give mention the young playedly.

But I think the subject matter deserves serious consideration and I am pleased that the people behind this movie have made a documentary as well which I hope will have its debut on BBC and other TV networks.

If you want to be an anti-Israeli, then by all means watch this film, as it really justifies just such a belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, even worse, such a talented Israeli director, is a crying shame. Indeed, just how Israel can be surprised to be regarded as a pariah State when Israelis themselves make such anti-Israel propaganda, beggars belief.<br /><br />What a shameful, horrid little film!

I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie, however, did not meet my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There wasn't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialog didn't explain adequately what was happening. It just seemed slapped together and rushed through. All in all I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be ok by itself. At the very least, it might entice you to read the book, which you'll probably enjoy more.<br /><br />
This is a good movie. Something fun about watching money be blown at a super rate, especially from a kid's point of view. Take it for what it is, a fun little movie about a kid's dream coming true, and what a kid might do with $1 million dollars. Don't like it, don't watch it. They make movies for the watchers, not the people that have nothing better to do then complain in their lives.

This is probably of the worsties ever made. Its...rible. But its so good! Its probably best if yout watch it expecting a gpping plot and something fantastically clever anding, because you're be., you want to watch it so can see 50 million vases and Goros fantastic hair/bad English, you' in a treat. The harder you think about the film the it gets, unless youre having a competition to spot the most plot holes/screw ups, in case you've got ofment ahead. I'd only really recommend this film for the bored or the diehard Smap fans. And even then, the latter should be a bit careful, becauseoros Japanese fans were a bitet about it, they thought he was selling himself out. (He wasn't really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).
This movie providedING orwhile. After seeing, my I that the studio simplyed out and have less wasing. a a "concept" film--they a concept a film and the other details areimportant becausesW make $$ just the initial concept.<br /> />The movie starts with Cruella prison and going on She longeratesies but has been to them--she simplyt hurt a.

It was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money (there can't be any other reason). Cruella's low self-esteem servant, Tim McInnerny, was funny in the Black Adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny. And it must have cost a few bucks to get Gérard Depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well. There were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were, I am trying to block them out of my mind.<br /><br />Overall, you'd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel.

Bad script, bad direction, over the top performances, overwrought dialogue. What more could you ask for? For laughs, it just doesn't get any better than this. Zadora's over-acting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the "Hollywood" machine. Almost as funny as "Spinal Tap" even though it was clearly not intended as such. Don't miss Ray Liotta's debut film line, "Looks like a penis."
I do regret that I have bought this series. I expected more action, more objective picture and more consistency. This is just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm, or romanticism, it is just boredom itself. I find the actors work quite weak as well. O'Donnell might seem charming as Robin (with Batman), but in this picture he lacks any charm. Probably while he becomes older, he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up. It comes as no surprise, that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.
The worst movie in the history of cinema. I don't know if it was trying to be funny or sad, poignant or droll, but the end result was unwatchable. Everyone from Key Grip, to Robin Williams, and back down to Best Boy should be ashamed to be a part of this film!
Starts really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost.<br /><br />The character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from American Pie and Loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the Pieies more of a commercial success /> />Lets be honest - Heders acting was pretty poor.

Buster absolutely shines in this episode, which is the only vehicle I've seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical (and silent!) comedy that made him famous. It's still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is about the only thing I don't care for, as far as Buster is concerned - but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled. He even repeats some of the gags used in his early two-reelers with Roscoe Arbuckle.<br /><br />My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling for presenting us with this episode, and for giving Buster's genius full scope. He didn't have much time (one episode) to do it in, but this is a touching tribute to Hollywood's greatest genius.
Monika Mitchell's showbiz satire has some laughs and some premeditated violence. I wouldn't say blood-soaked; but there is insult and injury. Max Matteo(John Cassini)is a character actor that has a quirky adaptable presence on screen, but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after. There is always a producer's nephew or seemingly trivial reason for his not being awarded the role he seeks. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of the competition...Max becomes obsessed with such thoughts. The rewarding career is just a swing, push and shot away. Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and cameos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, that's show business...or is it?
I saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity. (For one, if Stallone is out free-climbing by himself, there's no need to carry any gear, but I guess those dangling carabiners look sorta "mountain climby," so let's throw them in). For those lobotomized folks who think that Colorado looks anything like the Dolomites in Italy (where the movie was filmed), well the Hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous & foul-smelling stuff for you to swallow.
This movie was packed pull of endless surprises! Just when you thought it couldn't get worse, they added more joints and more pink fuzzy-lined vans with raunchy sex scenes. As you can guess, I was a victim of the original version. We were tricked into watching it thinking it was Supervan, the host box which promised lasars, jail breaks, and much more. Who would have thought a Dollar Store Christmas present could have been so much fun!

The story at the outset is interesting: slavery in the (late) 2th century from west Africa to the Arab East. The problem with it is that itally castates two of director Richard Fleishers favorite enemies: Arabs andans. To make us believe that very Arab-looking men would be free toam around and easily catch Blacks in Africa is as asites hunting for slaves in "ots". Obviously both trades areere run byals and involve) much moreated networks. While Arab countries arelicit ins child and sex slave trade, Israel is one of the worstators toesty International. So why only point out Arabs and then choose a German as the only Europeanyer? Its obvious bias andred of those people by a Jewish director.<br /> />The acting is above average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is good as always.
This film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life. We get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight. A very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war don't just happen on the front.<br /><br />Luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great-grandparents, grandparents or parents went through during a war. This film, I think, is a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazingly like a young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and as Australian as he can be. It's definitely worth listening to him recite "High Flight" and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with Shakespeare.

By the end, they've forged a real bond of respect for each other. Kazan did a good job with that.<br /><br />Pretty much all the performances here were excellent. Widmark and Douglas were great, and I was quite taken with a very early look at Jack Palance playing what would become his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes came across as a little bit flat as Reed's wife Nancy, but her role wasn't really central to the story. All in all, an excellent piece of work. 9/10

Samantha Morton (another actress who would go on to bigger things) is perhaps closer to the Harriet of the novel than was Toni Collette.<br /><br />This was the more small-scale of the two versions, being made for television rather than the cinema, and the sets and costumes seem less lavish and there are fewer big names among the cast. Costume drama, however, is generally something that British television does well, and this version can certainly hold its own with the cinema version; both are entertaining and well-made versions of Austen's novel. 7/10

It's got an over-sharp, saturated look that really suits the southwestern US locale. But that can't save the truly feeble writing nor the paper-thin (and annoying) characters. Even if you're a fan of the end-of-the-world genre, you should save yourself the agony of watching Carriers.

There are so many other things to say about this incredible film. Paul Wegener was an amazing actor and director, a cultural hero of mine. It helps if you know a bit about German history at the time this film was made and about German doppelganger tradition (don't google it, get a proper book)Just remember, it's a very early film, it's a little clumsy at times, but considering what it has to say and it's tragic finale, it's one of the best ever (yes it Is!)

I've seen many of Guy Mins films, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. John Gurdebeke's editing is way too frenetic, and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does nothing but interere with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.<br />br />Another thing I dised about this film was that it seemed more brutal than Mins earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the movies aning feeling of humanity. This one seemed more like harshness for harshness' sakebr />br />As I'm required to add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review, I will mention that the actor playing "Guyin" does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well.

When I saw the movie I figured maybe Lundgren had done it as some kind of charity work for some film school where he is the teacher. Like maybe this movie was their end of the year exam. It was a test to watch it, but I passed.
I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial. The commercial was great, but it I found out later that it had every explosion or 'special effect' in the entire movie (about 4) and even some that weren't in the movie. There was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as I remember. It was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people. I guess my world of innocence ended that day, when I found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies.

When did we last laugh at "Jerry! Jerry!"? when we were, say, seven years old? I came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film's existence.
I had the pleasure of viewing this movie early and I have to say I thought that it was going to be boring and wondered how could they ever improve upon the 1984 version of Bachelor Party starring Tom Hanks, which I thought was pretty good...I was right...In all honesty I thought it could have been better...Sure there were some funny moments but it just didn't seem to hit the mark with me...The acting was OK and the storyline pretty well follows the original but I think it could have been so much better...This movie I'd say is for teens and the young of heart; full of female bodies, alcohol and sex...It's just another typical run of the mill party movie that has been done over and over again. 4/10 is my vote for this one.
HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM. The film's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great. The stooges are always funny when they cook. However after the first few minutes of cooking footage, we cut to original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes are that they do fit with the new story. They do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't match.<br /><br />HUSBANDS BEWARE does have a new ending, but I won't give it away to those who want to be surprised.<br /><br /> **** out of 4 stars.
I just to say that I am so glad somebody finally spans this movie.vo "The Spaz",! This movie is aousce of filmmaking.pecially for a student film! I just to give credit to the Sp for taking theurd of time a care to find such a rare picture, and then TO CO IT! Most people knowt have that of time, especially so few will end of reading it.os you sir!, the movie follows a thin storyline that is at the least unable and just plain silly. I understand the idea behind creating a satire of Charlieels but why hire such atciouses! Also, what of director has himself act, write, produce and also edit the picture! Choose one job and put all your love into it! It's such a shame because I hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush. Again, thanks to the Spazz for pulling back the curtain on this film, people like you are a rare find.
I just finished watching Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and make them watch. I even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? As for the writing, if thats what you want to call it, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in Hell!! I believe that somewhere I read that the budget for this film was $10,000 and they were way under. Did Wallmart get a good deal on this? Every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is you can use the DVD as a coaster, or trade it to a friend, but then they might not be your friend anymore!!
Never viewed this film and it a great Classic with great veter actors. In the period that made, people in America were different, was no TV or the modern today, except the Radio and the starting of great films made Hollywood. Sweet innocent tales of youngance between a young girl ory was viewed differently than today. Annley,"Mderweet",'44 played a youngphan gal who was called Carrot Top because her hair and found herself being taken into a home of twolyks, who were like two wisels and over Annley. was a small town and knew everyone and if anything happened, the town out it within minutes. It is a down earth film with nice decent people to help other in a very very simple way of living. Today, it seems very corn ball and stupid, but believe me, this was the way people were in America during the 1920'. & 30's and they were a great generation that loved good family films.

This is horous.ent scenes or, the is, like you tellre reading lines a. Withful delivery by everyone cast. Think a play and the obvious of smoothness thes interactions (weirdes between different character, with hurried delivery by). If the movie were action, this be but a the movie includes plot set and Family Guy style,ent cutways (,, are they badly). I'm assuming they were to beny with these but it again as a of high-ers/ college entry students off for the afternoon to up anyoutube.br />Now the. They're not too bad, considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film. Nothing great either, certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated (Nothing like Drunken Master). The fights have an overly staged feel, with LOTS of cuts to different angles with blatantly different positions by those involved. <br /><br />In sum, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guy's friends involved with this very, very cheap production. Which guy you may ask? Oh, the same guy who wrote, directed, produced AND stared in this Middle School masterpiece.
Famous words of foreign nightclub owner Roman Maroni, that "ly cork sucker" who spends the whole movie not only as Johnny Dangerouslys rival but butchering the language as well.<br /> />Another underated classic that you can only find on afternoon matinées or "Late Late Late Show"s, Johnny Dangerously is a terrific satirical hit about a good hearted boy wholy leads a life of crime to help pay for hiss medical care and put his brother through school />Yes theres a story, but whoes?? A cast that includes Piso, Domise, Marilner, and Alan Hale Jr will keep you waiting to see what happens next />Theres too many laughs in this to put on here. Like Airplane, you have to pay attention or you'll miss something. Highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two!!!
In one respect, it's like 'The Wizard of Oz,' with Paris in black-and-white and the Riviera in color. But it's supposedly about possessive love, destructiveness and moral decadence, while actually being about designer gowns, shots of the Riveria, lots of big expensive cars, and music-and dancing interludes that suggest Vincente Minnelli on one of his off-days. Watchable, but a remarkable example of desperate, dark plot material and glitzy style heading in opposite directions. (Was this the model for 'The Talented Mister Ripley? Does anyone sense an affinity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)

The usual mix of characters who will die horribly as cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to get blown away.<br /><br />Avoid this film like you would avoid walking in front of a speeding train or a dose of H5N1 avian flu.<br /><br />Utter garbage.<br /><br />1/10<br /><br />This has been a public health warning.
The makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters,as they suffered through this horrible ordeal.The horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors,playing parts.I have never gotten so immersed in a film as I have this one.Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on screen,as well as fine performances by Ned Beatty,Ronny Cox,Bill McKinney,and though he appeared only briefly,James Dickey,the man who authored the book upon which the film is based,as the sheriff of Aintry.It is somewhat disturbing,and kids,of course,should be shielded from it,but this is great,dramatic cinema.
*** Spoilers*<br />< />Myad had taped this movie for me was 3. By 5 I had it over 0 times. I just it and it. And I still do today! It has a grim storyline, a lambs mother is killed by aolf--a veryional scene--and wants to become aolf, like him. After of training, theamb is made a really REY evil looking thing. He and theolf travel to his oldn, but he cannot kill theambs, matter how much he wishes to. He up killing theolf, but is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends, and cant return to his previous of life />The art is beautiful, the are..well, okay, and the voice is better than some things today.<br /><br />All in all, you just *have* to see this movie, it is a great masterpiece. Although, it's very hard to find today.<br /><br />

The movie fails miserably in this attempt.<br /><br />I recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new "worst ever" movie to relate to. And to fans of the genre I recommend "Cyborg" since I think it's a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor. And if you can't stand Van Damme then check out "Nemesis".<br /><br />I rated this movie 1/10.

He was terrific in most of his films, just not this one (well, and a few others). I don't despise AAIP itself, either; it has good points, like the art direction. And Leslie Caron, who despite her inexperience is rather charming, and really does look like she just stepped out of a painting. Georges Guetary does a fine job and his "Stairway to Paradise" is my favorite number in the movie. Nina Foch is beautiful and touching and should have ended up with SOMEBODY. But not Jerry Mulligan. I wouldn't wish that on her.
Just given the that it is on the mostous masside incident of modern times would have been enough to give this 2-part 1980TV film attention.

But it is Powers Boothe (in his first big role) that really stands out as Jim Jones. He actually BECOMES the man, and his performance is riveting and chilling. Thus, it is no wonder that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years.
a movie that attempts to be fararter than its makers are capable of producing. the movie twists and turns through miriad plot "surises" at a desperate attempt to kep the audience guessing, offcourse puncturing the "plot" with steamy scenes they thought would help it along.<br />br />james belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and just sleepks through the movie. the same applies for the other "actors". the plot is quite silly and tacky. whih in itelf is not such a crime, but towards the end, the tremendous plot-twists get very tiresome and boring />br />however, the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle. in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day, but dont fret if you miss this one.<br />br />a rather lame 4!

This was of those films I probably have picked offelf , but it came on IFC one day and I said - Eric Stz, William Fthe... not? If I'd changed channel, I have really missed aasure. <br /> />The subject is deing - young authored in accident conesces in lower-class reitation center. It would been easy anding to make this aulativearker. But, thatt happen because it was written by Neenez, after he himself was accidentlyed. No Hollywood happiness here. All the patients in theard come fromly differents, but they share a ofness, of being the of others.z is good as a "loneolf" type, forced into embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is fine as a former ladies' man whose family is falling apart; but William Forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to make someone pay for taking away his independence.<br /><br />See this film.

Another wonderful Patterson book made into an incredibly awful movie. If the big budget movies don't work then why make a low budget made for t.v. movie that's 10 times worse! I am desperate for a good movie that will do ONE of his books justice!
The basic hook is: Lincoln Is Slow. It is his slow that represents hisfulness and deliberation, him a Greatader who is here in singlehandedlyizing the Americanier through the grand instrument of Law. All that John Ford hooey and more, including one lurking slave and extraneous Death By Injun. However! The 'slow'it is also at the of one brilliant of movie-making, funny and moving ates. The history may be bunk, but the telling it suggests a of history as process thatires some excitingly true-ing moments. Check out Henryondas big introory stroll across the deck, his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river, his with Maryd on thech, and theeless business that follows 'Ma'am, we've got to hurry!' Things do thin out once we settle into the big courtroom drama; but Fonda is priceless throughout.
'The Rookie' was a wonderful movie about the second chances life holds for us and also puts an emotional thought over the audience, making them realize that your dreams can come true. If you loved 'Remember the Titans', 'The Rookie' is the movie for you!! It's the feel good movie of the year and it is the perfect movie for all ages. 'The Rookie' hits a major home run!

Rachel Griffiths writes and directs this award winning short film. A heartwarming story about coping with grief and cherishing the memory of those we've loved and lost. Although, only 15 minutes long, Griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time. Bud Tingwell gives a touching performance as Will, a widower struggling to cope with his wife's death. Will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of Ruth's pet cow, Tulip. The film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost. Good cinematography, great direction, and superbly acted. It will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one, and survived.

It's just another one of those crappy shows that Cartoon Network is over-promoting to trick people to watching it (like MTV toward rap). If you need a show that will satisfy your children for a half hour, you'd better stick to Spongebob, because Johnny Test is more of a "test" of patience than anything else.

And there's enough space within them to reflect on how absurd we humans can be. I can't say that I'll watch the collection again, but for anyone who revelled in the movements that is the suite Inland Empire, Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time.

Thirdly, I did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way. In fact, the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch. Wonderfully casted, and superbly acted across the board. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best one I've seen since "Return of the King" (not that I am comparing the two at all). OK, so its not that easy to sum up, but don't let any crude and/or heartless and cynical review nor the film's pathetic PR prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer (or even possibly in a long time)!
Kept my attention from start to finish. Great performances added to this tremendous film. Mr. Pacino once again gives us another brilliant character to enjoy.
I think that movie can`t be a Scott`s film. That is impossible. Do you remember Blade Runner? And Alien? Two greats movies versus a one. I hope didn´t see ever it. good bye!!
A tragically wonderful movie... brings us to a Japan that does not exist anymore. Despite Hollywood's technicalise, I have yet to see a (hollywood) movie that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river near the sea... Tom Cruises The Last Samai looked liked the lastment of the Lord of Theings in trying to capture rural Old Japan.<br />br />If you like serene butse story lines, this is a must see film. It will be a respite from hollow flashy films much like the last 1000 blockbusters you saw. I think this is one ofrosawa's better stories.<br />br />Even if its a movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such settings, it did not turn into a skin flick. The characters are full of depth and act with much intensity.
There is one use for a film asletproof: itinds you how bad bad. We often see films which we as "pretty awful" "not good but then you across a film like this and you can see that although all those filmst "good" they are no way as stinkingly as. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two secondsagingru the DVD b bin at local superstore to fulfilation (. to give me a present). It could been aous find but itt: this is soly clichéd, so badly soly directed, so acted that I'm surprised involvedt been arrested and sent down for 0 years. God,s awful. Ipected as much from about 30 seconds in, but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable. This isn't one of them. It is simply bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I shall throw it in the bin.
this movie is a very relaxed, romantic-comedy, which is thoroughly enjoyable. Meg Ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of Albert Einstein, though she does believe in her own skills. Tim Robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fiancé after her car stuffs up. I loved Walter Matthau as the one and only Albert Einstein. This movie just has a very relaxing feel to it, while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it (if that is actually possible, it happens here).<br /><br />I personally found this movie extremely entertaining, especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious! This movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension. If you have a cheeky sense of humour, this is the movie for you!

I am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho-hum event . Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film , probably the most intriquing figure of the period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger , ditto , and Bloody Bill Anderson , who would weep for his murdered sister every time he went into battle was completely absent in the script. Instead we were forced to watch fictitious characters that never developed into anyone we cared about. how sad. The costumes were wonderful however, as was the location shooting in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee will make another film from the period and try again, or some other film maker will look into the tremendous wealth of material to write a screen play on .
I remember seeing this film when it out in982 & it then. About  years later I the of seeinganootti sing the Opera York (inca) so seeing the of film rem me that great night. Whats to? music is brilliant andotti (Fini) was at his best and still looked great. The is actually veryny in parts & the 'od' scene is still ofest I seen. The hoton flight the Napa valley was beautiful & so the song sang "If we were" ( of the few timesotti sang in English). And hearing theet ofcia gous. Get realks this was a film about singer called Georgio Fini who just happened to be played by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles.<br /><br />I am VERY glad that I still have this almost worn out VHS tape of this movie but I would love this to be released on DVD especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him still on film today!
I'm all for a "bad" horror movie but this was just a pile of dog sh!t! How anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me. If you like rushed editing to cover the special effects, bad acting and a bad script then go for it! There was no suspense whatsoever and the gore factor was laughable because it was so fake. I'll take Hostel or Wolf Creek over this pile any day. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, she knows a stinker when she sees one. I on the other hand stupidly sat through the whole movie just to wait and see if it got any better. No such luck! I haven't sen his other movie Torched and I doubt if I'll bother now.
Is nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, then watch Phat Beach. However, dont rent it and definitely NOT buy it. That would be a big mistake.<br />br />I watched this on TV and found myselfughing at certain points. I did not laugh long and I not laugh hard., there were subtleokes and comments I laughed at. If you are looking for an extremelyny "hood" movie then watch Friday. If you are looking for a powerfulional movie (something that this movie tries at..kind of) watch something like hoops or Jasonsric. If you are lookin for some good black "y" go watch a Dominique Simone pornlick, because the nity in this movie is nearly nonexistent. However, if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable, go ahead and watch it. You will be slightly amused.<br /><br />***3 out of 10***
"Dutchz", AA Arthur Fleggen a real person and his rathery life is. This movie which to life should have used a character, the overatized events are too strong from the facts and theology. Not, itores some interesting details which other versions have included as the public relationsco instate. and his. It is that was executed byano,ky, et but thats as. The exploding plate scene which representsano execution of Boberg in his own home, by his own mother is., is the scene which Dutch approaches his mother to pay protection toond. It justt. The of Mrs. Fleggenheimer doesn't work either. This movie does not need a doting Jewish mother for comic relief. The lame representation of Legs Diamond was humorous enough. I'm sure the man is turning in his grave. And, by the way, Dutch did in fact personally kill people, but, he was not Rambo or 007. The scene in which he wipes out the brewery is absurd. I don't know. Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and I just didn't get it.
This is all no. The actors put of into the but these numbers oftent the film like stand. And no the numbers sound were happening in you, every one like its a, essentiallying life the. stage the performances were all un, especially Hudson who essentially same, "" (s and) woman seen. was no, any other. I think the movie that character faces her, it is really own to do what the that, making the film totally.s Award a, noification. she she put forthotion ( was often but the she to out. character with he but still not the was who, made something. nothing to no or, The was that be ofs one the number is with other so longed it could pass for a Family Guy skit. The movie has no idea what it's about, and I felt insulted by the last few minutes. It's a big, boring waste of time, and really is the worst film I saw in '06, and nothing last year was really stellar to begin with.
The coming attractions to "The Order" make it seem like a decent horror mystery/thriller, but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage.<br /><br />First off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects. The acting was also nothing to be proud of, but Keath Ledger (I think I spelled that right.) saved the movie in this category.<br /><br />For heaven's sake: DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!
This entry is certainly interesting for series fans (like myself), but yet it is mostly incomprehensible. The plot is confusing, as is the sequel continuity. Some striking effects, to be sure, but we never find out what it all really means.<br /><br />Try to see the "NC-17" workprint version which contains the gore that was cut to be re-rated "R".

For a "no budget" movie this thing rocks. I don't know if America's gonna like it, but we were laughing all the way through. Some really Funny Funny stuff. Really non-Hollywood.<br /><br />The Actors and Music rocked. The cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up. Whooo Whooo!<br /><br />I've seen some of the actors before, but never in anything like this, one or two of them I think I've seen in commercials or in something somewhere. Basically it Rocked! Luckily I got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors.

Why? Why did they make this movie? If Timothy Olyphant wasn't shirtless in it several times, there would be ABSOLUTELY no reason to watch this movie, ever. Um...Plot? Nope. Well-defined characters? nope. The only time I laughed was when my boyfriend made fun of the whole she-bang. P.S. Andy Dick? Nope.
This movie is not great, but it is a good andable one. It feels like an indie film made out of a play script. Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, although the director swears the script was not written for him. And there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he hasnt committed to yet. I mean, he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it :)<br /><br />I found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste, but refhing noneless. This is a film that inspires thewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go. A bit too much emphasis on appearance, if you ask mebr />br />Bottom line: a nice little film, made in two weeks, with basically two actors and a fewtras, dialogue driven, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
Nationalon was once any magazine. Whether you liked the ster hiie of the lateies the smug and sy coke-head theies (when the comedy wasified with of nakedes) depends on your birth, but everyone that theies, middle age had killed off whver remaining spark of anicour that the drugst, and offerings like this film and thely terrible-off records shot further in theull. Out of a nicely illustrated title sequence, theres nothing to recommend this singularlying stinkbug. you make through the bling opening segment, 'Gingelf', hoping things will,ough luck - they. Whoever thought the of a woman beingally raped with a stick of butter was comedy gold deserved to have his head handed back to him on a platter of dog mess. If there's ever a global shortage of guitar picks, the negatives of this rambling, incoherent ragbag of crummy ideas and dire performances may well serve some purpose.
Its not a big film. The is noting (some sub charterers are even played badly), The film is not beautiful in any sense. Nothing really or new. you like big films, this one. yet it has a big - REIG plus on the story. Larrys story works, because we know this story from our own lives. The girl wet ask to a the test we've the friend we down, all in our history. This movie works it touch it, Its a great storys a small one.s the life we all have, withrets all have, and yet the message hits: every life we have lived would have had their downside. The first I watched it I was15. It was shown in a party at my school. 16 years later, I keep reflecting on it every once in a while, and every time I see it, it puts a smile on my face. Watch it. It will do you good. You'll be happier with what you have.
The only reason I saw "Shown" was that it has Erikak in it. Shesxy as always, but she plays second fiddle to leading man Wolfson. Its a pity, because she has more action capabilities than shes allowed to show here. The film largely ofless shootouts that quickly becomeous - especially when most of the time you are seeing the bad guys armed with guns constantly missingson and him armed with aver (thatVER out oflets) taking them all out rather easily. The earthquake effects are decent, but there is also a of blurry motion and poor CGI explosions. As the psychotic "spiritual leader", Ronman tries, but the pseudo-iousbobo he toout is simply boring. Elk,man orson (assuming he has any) completists might want to give this one a look, for others it is barely worth a rental. (*1/2)
I saw this film first on my way home from Paris to Newark abard Air France in August 996. The film itself I believe is quite a masterce. Its the kind of film that people should be making. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of theest actors around. In this French film, he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life until he across a Downrome man who lives in an institution with other Downrome patients. The actors including the actor who actually has Downrome create aable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniels life and ours changes forever with the Downrome man. He realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living anding and thats what life should be about. The ending is kind of silly though but I still think its one of my favorite movies. It's enough to bring a tear to your eye.
Brilliant adaptation of the largely interiorologues of Leopoldom, Stephenalus andlyom by Joseph Strick in recreating the endearing portrait of Dublin on16 4 -day - a day to be celebrated - double entendre intended!vo directorick, screenwriter Haines, as as casting director and cinemater in creating this masterce. Gunter Grass' novel, Theummed byker Schlff (79)is another fine film adaptation ofologue which I favorably compare withicks film.<br /> />While there are clearly recognized Dublinmarks in the original novel and in the film, there are alsoizable characters, although with different names in the novel. For example, Migan with whomalus lives turns out be a then prominent Dublin surgeon. <br /><br />This film for all of its excellence is made even richer by additional viewings. <br /><br />Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com 15 June 2008
This is what I call a "pre Scii; Scii" movie. It gets no better than Losi/Kff in this incredibly good "mood" type motion picture. These two genuine artists are at their very best, as is the story line.<br /> />ff does aning job as aist that sees himself caught in a vise ofity, pride, and scientific competition. I was caught up in the idea of watching a man as he dns himself in the three previously mentioned concepts. I was saded and at timeated with the two stars as they do themselves in. />This is the of picture that begs for a remake. This time put Ford in theff part and maybe Kiefferland as the Bela Lagosi role. It might be possible to do it almost as good.<br /><br />This is one of the very best that Hollywood EVER produced. As I said..it gets no better. No way.

I saw this movie yesterday on Turner, and I was unable to stop watching until it was over, even though I sort of could guess what would happen. Farrell was great in her role, and everyone else did a super job. Some of it seemed to stretch the limits, but all in all, I loved it!! If you get the chance to see it, please do! I actually cried at a few scenes, but then I guess if you are a mom you would. Loretta is beautiful, and I was just in astonishment at the very idea of their being unwed moms there, it seemed ahead of its' time. I say, WATCH IT if you can, and don't listen to criticisms. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I thoroughly enjoyed it!
This is a quky movie that the Brits do well. Low budget, cameo type roles, well executed. The story is a little weak, a recentlyowed Jchides to up the "blonde bombells' a all (well almost all) girl band who performed during the war in London. The obligatory son/ter who thinks shes gonety. I did like the way the movie lets young people see that theyt have ay on feelings, love and even lust! That the "oldinklies" can have a good laugh too.udich was superb as always, a pity wet get see more of the other "bl bombells, the end was a little rushed I thought. I kept thinking as I watched that David Jason would have made an even better Patrick than Ianm, although he was quitequate as the "transvestite" drummer. All in all a cheery movie well worth a night in with the girls :)
Takashi Mkes inc into kie territory won over almost immediately because heates nerve and bravery in with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that d to be dark. Even as a kid, I thought that somethingister about most tales; horrible things happen to people in mosts books.kes that these classic tales are a bitier (and more than what they appear be at first glance. The filmmaker takes theetypical story a kid a wous quest of the proolroom. He accates the very real fears of a world withendingzardousions. Westerners like toplay the seriousness behindtime stories written specifically forids. I appreciated the thatke was more honest than most Americanmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain. But a self-possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a great film. Highly recommended.
Hello again, I have to comment on this wonderful, exciting, and believable tale of romance and intrigue. The music in wonderful and memorable. Very good colorful movie. Another movie I liked as well later on was High Society with Bing Crosby. Wonderful music. Thanks for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
Drum scene is wild! Cook, Jr. is unsung hero of this and many movies. Fantastic actor, great flick. A few twists that keep you moving. A must-see.
this movie was arible for.... first, the casting could better; Kn the character looked like her TV mom. <br /> /> the was pathedic. was extremely. the was verying and. (but thats all i' that). />the nail the bag though was a scene whenn (jan) was being but the girlt cry on command! there were tears, just a few unable. she is a dynamic actress. she gave the same fake little laugh to that offf onzieire (sp). thats when the movie from not-good to plain. it really looked like she was acting. <br /><br />in a nutshell: this movie was really bad! it was kind of a mix of every cliché kid movie from the 1990's that everyone's sick of--only worse!<br /><br />i give it an 'F', because it was just so darn hard to sit through (b/t/w, i was babysitting when i saw it). <br /><br />however, you may like it if your 9 or under. ;)
Unfortunately for me, the first Busbykeley movie I ever watched was " Street." I then expected all of his to be that good. I found out thatt necessarily case, even here, with my all-time favorite classic-era actorney.<br /> />Oh, the musical numbers at the end are asular as always, but the story is like many of the others and quite tome. They seem to always involve screaming, unhappy showcers. In this film, its Cney who uping things out so often that he gives me aache after awhile and his characterars thin....fast! />Even the songs in here are anywhere near " Street" class, songs you could hum for years and years -ades, I say. The songs in this movie are notable. No, this is one of the few early Cagney films - and Berkeley films - I totally dislike and was very disappointed with while watching.

I first saw this film around ten years ago and I thought it was very funny indeed. It was not as bad as some critics were making it out to be. The fact that it was written by the usually dependable John Hughes shows that you can at least expect some funny dialogue. (By the way, I also think Weird Science is quite good which was also penned in lightning speed by Hughes).<br /><br />The film has a very garish look to it using all the primary colours - reds, yellows etc - which makes it look quite unique. The cast are also quite good. The prudish Bunny Packard and the devil-possessed Delores Salk are a stand out.<br /><br />The film has certainly dated a little but I personally prefer it to all the other 'Lampoon' series.
This film is great. As often, is indeed very and sometimesal but unlike other people I am not ising, or disling Austria aist. the contrary: While are some very heavy scenes in HUNDSTAGE some characters are be called very bad, time you watch, beauty and in Ulrich. And thats whatishesAGE me films that to the of the ' in anse way; theirle their their sides:l clearly never to prove that the the working areash! In,ers who this conclusion to be very ofitting that nearly nobody's live is as 'clean' and 'normal' as we would like other people to believe. And that every live has its dark and often depressing sides. The most beautiful scene: The old Viennese man, watching his old girl dancing 'the oriental way', as he is calling it. I think everybody who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is, that's proto-fascist: The characters in HUNDSTAGE or viewers, who are turned off by the body of a 70+ year old woman, dancing with all her charms for her lover.

I have nothing against a fasted fright- but this King-ivedense is too freshly-bed too bright and modern. The plot, a newenage boy in town who is a "Ser"-- of a between a aolf--and who on the of female,s for a more,ous. Thisiller is given an inropriatelyful look and, with hardly any atmosphere. The kids areably and, but the big is Alice Kridge thes mother;ridge, from "Ghost Story", never broke out of the filler-fale, ands a huge loss shet been used more. Her performance isy and, and gives hint that "Sleepwalkers" might've been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction. It's too over-the-top and commercially-driven, with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama. Stephen King pops up in a cameo, as do real-life directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. *1/2 from ****
I admit, I had to fast forward through this poorly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes -- NOTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the "plot." But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stbed through a wig and its impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, put its never explained. Really trippy opening.<br /><br />I wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense isnt a "clever" movie, its just a poorly executed filmbr />br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missingage, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is an odd little film that is best if fast-forwarded through!

While more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago, Ron Howard's film still has its comic value. It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount Widescreen Collection and is a tad short-changed. Audio options are provided in English 5.1 surround, English Dolby surround, and French 'dubbing,' but subtitles are in English only. There are no extras, not even the theatrical trailer. On the plus side, Paramount's digital transfer is quite good, with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound. While a few extras would have been helpful - especially that 'Gung Ho' was a box office success - there's little to complain about the film presentation itself.<br /><br />*** out of 4

I'm so confused. I've been a huge Se for2 years. I seen his films, and of those. I can only describe this as "re."al shares screenplay writing andits film, but I have a really time he would to dub own voice for so many of lines, with a,iny imposter voice. What I alsot is, if they had to dub SO lines why does his voice appear on the of? I expectal to age us. But theal this moviely exudes a the sameagger,, bra,, and sexal he so easily showed in his previous. What I found myself missing most of all was his cocky, self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin. Where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star??? I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, his lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all knew and loved is gone.
